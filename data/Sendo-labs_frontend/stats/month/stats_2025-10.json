It also removes legacy files and dependencies related to the previous stack. The changes modernize the codebase, improve developer experience, and set up new conventions for code quality and workflow.\r\nFrom React / TailwindV3 / Javascript to Nextjs / TailwindV4 / Typescript.\r\n\r\n**Migration to Next.js and Bun:**\r\n\r\n* Migrated from Vite+React to Next.js 15, updating `package.json` scripts, dependencies, and project name to `sendo`, and switched to Bun as the package manager. Legacy dependencies and scripts were removed.\r\n* Added `next.config.ts` for Next.js configuration and updated the project entry points accordingly.\r\n* Updated `README.md` to Next.js boilerplate and added `CLAUDE.md` for project guidance, architecture, and workflow documentation.
