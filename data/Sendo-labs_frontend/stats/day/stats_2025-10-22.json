      "body": "This pull request refactors several main pages (`analyzer`, `leaderboard`, `worker`, and the new `onboarding` page) to use a shared layout component, `PageWrapper`, for consistent styling and structure. It also introduces a new onboarding flow and makes minor improvements to the contact section. These changes improve code maintainability, visual consistency, and user onboarding experience.\r\n\r\n**Shared Layout Refactor:**\r\n\r\n* Replaced custom layout wrappers in `src/app/analyzer/client.tsx`, `src/app/leaderboard/client.tsx`, and `src/app/worker/client.tsx` with the shared `PageWrapper` component, ensuring consistent page structure and reducing duplicated code.
