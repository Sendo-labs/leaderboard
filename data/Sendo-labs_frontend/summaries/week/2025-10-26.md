# Sendo-labs/frontend Weekly Report (Oct 26 - 1, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was foundational for user interaction and data analysis on the Sendo platform. Development efforts centered on integrating core functionalities, including a robust authentication system with Privy to manage user sessions securely. Significant progress was made on the AgentAI experience, with the introduction of a new agent chat interface, streamlined worker creation, and the successful integration of the trade analyzer feature. A parallel focus on code quality and refactoring ensured that these new features were built on a consistent and maintainable codebase, paving the way for more advanced agent capabilities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on shipping major new features while simultaneously improving the underlying code structure.

- **Authentication and Security**
    - A comprehensive authentication system was integrated using Privy, enabling both client-side and server-side session management. This crucial update involved modifying core components, providers, and environment configurations to establish a secure user foundation ([#10](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/10)).

- **Agent & Worker Enhancements**
    - The user experience for interacting with agents was significantly upgraded by replacing the old `AgentPanel` with a new, more interactive `AgentChat` component ([#13](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/13)).
    - The worker analysis workflow was refactored to be more efficient, replacing a manual suggestion button with automatic polling for analysis results ([#12](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/12)).
    - A new feature for worker creation was introduced ([#16](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/16)), and a pull request for `worker-code` was opened ([#14](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/14)), advancing the project's goal of allowing users to build their own AgentAIs.

- **Analyzer Feature Integration**
    - The `analyzer` feature was merged into the main branch, introducing a suite of new client-side components and services for trade analysis. This includes new UI for performance metrics and services to handle trade data ([#17](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/17)). Minor follow-up refinements were made to improve the display of error messages ([#18](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/18)).

- **Code Quality and Refactoring**
    - A significant effort was dedicated to improving code quality across the repository. This included extensive reformatting, standardizing indentation, and ensuring consistent `async/await` syntax across agent, analyzer, and service files ([#11](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/11), [#15](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/15), [#16](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/16)).
