# Sendo-labs/frontend Weekly Report (Oct 26 - 1, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week saw foundational progress in user experience and agent functionality. Development efforts focused on integrating a new authentication system, significantly overhauling the agent interaction interface, and refactoring the backend worker process for better performance. After completing these major features, the team shifted focus toward code refinement and began laying the groundwork for new analyzer and worker-code functionalities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on improving core features, from user authentication to agent interaction and data processing.

- **New Authentication System**
  - A major feature was merged to integrate Privy for authentication, enabling robust client-side and server-side user authentication and session management across the platform ([#10](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/10)).

- **Enhanced Agent Interaction and Creation**
  - The user-facing agent interface was significantly upgraded by replacing the old `AgentPanel` with a new, more interactive `AgentChat` component ([#13](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/13)).
  - The worker analysis workflow was refactored to streamline data handling. This effort improved user waiting states and automated the data polling process by removing the manual "suggest" button ([#12](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/12)).

- **Code Quality and Refinement**
  - Several pull requests focused on improving code readability and maintainability. These changes included standardizing formatting, simplifying prop destructuring, and removing unnecessary code in agent creation functions, hooks, and utilities ([#11](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/11), [#16](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/16)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The issue tracker remained quiet this week, with development focused on implementing features through pull requests.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed this week.
- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were reported, and no existing issues saw significant discussion. However, several new pull requests were opened, indicating the next areas of focus:
  - `feat: worker-code` ([#14](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/14))
  - `feat: merge-analyzer` ([#17](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/17))
  - `refine: analyzer` ([#18](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/18))

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Development activity was consistent throughout the week, with a clear thematic focus each day. The progression from integrating authentication to enhancing the agent chat and refactoring the backend suggests a coordinated effort. While the reports do not indicate high levels of discussion on any single item, the steady stream of merged and newly opened pull requests points to a healthy and productive development pace.
