# Sendo-labs/frontend Weekly Report (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week marked the inception of the ElizaOS frontend project. Development kicked off with a significant foundational push, establishing the project's core structure, integrating key dependencies for the Eliza API, and scaffolding the initial user interface. The work focused on creating the necessary hooks and components for agent and chat management, setting the stage for future feature development. All major activity occurred at the beginning of the week, with no further developments reported in the subsequent days.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
All development this week was consolidated into a single, foundational effort to bootstrap the application.

- **Initial Project Scaffolding and Core Component Development:**
  The project's foundational structure was established in [#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/2). This included adding the core Eliza API dependencies to `package.json` and creating an `.env.example` for environment configuration. To manage application logic, new hooks (`useElizaAgent.js`, `useElizaChat.js`) were introduced for handling agent and chat state. A suite of essential UI components was also created, including `AgentSidebar.jsx`, `ChatInterface.jsx`, `AnimatedMarkdown.jsx`, and `Tool.jsx`, forming the building blocks of the agent interaction view.
