# Sendo-labs/frontend Weekly Report (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week marked the foundational kickoff for the Sendo-labs frontend project. Development was concentrated at the beginning of the week, establishing the core project structure and integrating key dependencies for the Eliza API. A suite of essential UI components and custom hooks for agent and chat management were created, laying the groundwork for the platform's primary user-facing features. Following this initial burst of activity, the remainder of the week was quiet with no further code contributions reported.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
All development this week was focused on establishing the initial application structure and core functionalities, consolidated within a single major pull request.

- **Initial Project Setup and Eliza API Integration:** The project's foundational structure was established with the creation of an `.env.example` for environment configuration and a `CLAUDE.md` guide for development. Core dependencies for the Eliza API were added to `package.json`, enabling the frontend to communicate with the agent backend. This work was completed in PR [#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/2).

- **Agent and Chat Management:** To manage state and logic for agent interactions, new hooks `useElizaAgent.js` and `useElizaChat.js` were introduced. A collection of UI components was also developed to build the agent interface, including `AgentSidebar.jsx`, `ChatInterface.jsx`, `AnimatedMarkdown.jsx`, `Markdown.jsx`, and `Tool.jsx`, all part of PR [#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/2).
