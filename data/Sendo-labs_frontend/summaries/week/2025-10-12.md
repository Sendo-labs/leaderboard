# Sendo-labs/frontend Weekly Report (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week marked the foundational launch of the Sendo-labs frontend project. Development was concentrated at the beginning of the week, with a significant initial commit that established the project's core structure and integrated key dependencies for the Eliza API. This foundational work included the creation of essential UI components and custom hooks for managing agent and chat interactions, setting the stage for future feature development. The remainder of the week saw no new activity.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
All development this week focused on establishing the initial framework for the application.

-   **Project Initialization and Core Component Scaffolding**
    -   The project's foundational structure was established, including configuration examples and development guidelines. Core dependencies for the Eliza API were integrated to enable agent interactions. This initial setup also saw the development of crucial hooks (`useElizaAgent.js`, `useElizaChat.js`) to manage application state and logic for agents and chats. A suite of essential UI components, including `AgentSidebar.jsx`, `ChatInterface.jsx`, `AnimatedMarkdown.jsx`, and `Tool.jsx`, was created to build out the user interface ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/2)).
