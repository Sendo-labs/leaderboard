# Sendo-labs/frontend Weekly Report (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week marked the inception of the ElizaOS frontend project. A significant foundational effort on October 12th established the entire project structure, integrated core Eliza API dependencies, and developed a suite of essential UI components and hooks. This initial burst of activity laid the groundwork for agent and chat management, setting the stage for future development. The remainder of the week was quiet, with no further code contributions or issue management activities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
All development this week was focused on establishing the initial application framework.

-   **Project Foundation and API Integration:** The project was initialized with its core structure, including configuration examples (`.env.example`) and development documentation (`CLAUDE.md`). Key dependencies for the Eliza API were added to `package.json`, enabling the frontend to communicate with the agent framework. This foundational work was completed in pull request [#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/2).

-   **Core UI and State Management:** A set of crucial features for the agent interface was built. This included React hooks (`useElizaAgent.js`, `useElizaChat.js`) to manage agent and chat state, as well as UI components like `AgentSidebar.jsx`, `ChatInterface.jsx`, `AnimatedMarkdown.jsx`, `Markdown.jsx`, and `Tool.jsx`. These components form the building blocks of the user-facing agent interaction experience, all introduced via [#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/2).
