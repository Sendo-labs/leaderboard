# Sendo-labs/frontend Weekly Report (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This period was defined by a significant architectural overhaul of the frontend application. The core focus was on migrating the project from a Vite+React setup to Next.js 15, a foundational shift aimed at enhancing performance and developer experience. This migration included adopting modern tooling like Bun and Biome. Concurrently, work was done to refactor the page structure, preparing the application for future server-side data fetching from AI agents.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
### Foundational Migration to Next.js
A major effort was completed to modernize the entire frontend stack. This involved a comprehensive migration to Next.js 15, which sets the stage for more advanced features and server-side rendering capabilities.
- The project was successfully migrated from Vite+React to a Next.js 15 application. As part of this, the development environment was updated to use Bun as the package manager and Biome for integrated linting and formatting ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/1)).
- In alignment with the migration, the page structure was refactored to follow Next.js best practices. This change is a preparatory step for a more robust data recovery strategy that will involve fetching user data from agents on the server ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/3)).
