# Sendo-labs/frontend Weekly Report (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was defined by a significant foundational shift for the frontend, migrating the entire application from Vite+React to Next.js 15. This major refactoring sets a new technical direction for the project, enabling improved page structures and data fetching strategies in preparation for integrating real user data. Following the migration, efforts focused on stabilizing the new development environment and beginning to enhance the user experience with a standardized page layout, a new onboarding flow, and several UI refinements.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on the migration to Next.js and subsequent improvements to the codebase and user interface.

### Foundational Migration to Next.js
The most impactful change was the complete migration from a Vite+React setup to a Next.js 15 application. This involved a major project-wide refactoring, updating configurations, and introducing Biome for linting and formatting ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/1)). In parallel, the page structure was enhanced to align with Next.js best practices for data fetching, laying the groundwork for a better data recovery strategy and moving away from mocked data ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/3)).

### Development Environment Stabilization
Following the migration, work was done to ensure a stable and consistent development environment. This included adding missing dependencies to `package.json` to prevent build issues ([#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/5)). Additionally, environment file handling was improved by updating `.gitignore` to manage local configurations (`.env.local`) and creating an `.env.example` template for new contributors ([#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/4)).

### UI/UX Enhancements and Refinements
Several changes were made to improve application consistency and user experience. A new shared `PageWrapper` component was introduced to standardize the layout across the `analyzer`, `leaderboard`, `worker`, and a new `onboarding` page ([#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/7)). The `worker-plugin`'s `RuleBuilder` component was refactored for better code readability ([#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/6)). Finally, the UI was simplified by removing the 'accepted' status from the `ActionHistory` component for greater clarity ([#8](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/8)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.
- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were reported this week. There were no active issues with significant discussion.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Development activity was steady and focused, driven by the major migration effort. A new pull request ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/2)) was opened early in the week to implement worker functionality, indicating ongoing feature development. The subsequent pull requests show a logical progression of work, with developers first establishing the new foundation and then moving to stabilize the environment and enhance the UI. The provided reports do not indicate broad community discussion or collaboration on these specific changes.
