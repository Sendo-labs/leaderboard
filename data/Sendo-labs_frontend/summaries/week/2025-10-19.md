# Sendo-labs/frontend Weekly Report (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was marked by a significant architectural overhaul of the frontend, migrating the entire project from Vite+React to Next.js 15. This foundational shift, managed with Bun, aims to improve performance, scalability, and data handling capabilities. Subsequent efforts focused on stabilizing the new environment by resolving dependency issues and refining configuration management. Alongside this refactoring, initial work began on a new worker implementation, setting the stage for future feature development.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on modernizing the project's core framework and ensuring a stable development environment.

-   **Project Migration to Next.js 15**
    A major refactoring effort saw the project transition from a Vite+React application to a Next.js 15 application, with Bun adopted as the package manager. This change included updating the project structure, configurations, and introducing Biome for consistent linting and formatting ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/1)). In line with this migration, page structures were refactored to align with Next.js best practices, preparing for a more robust data recovery strategy ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/3)).

-   **Environment and Dependency Stabilization**
    Following the migration, key maintenance was performed to ensure project stability. Missing dependencies were added to resolve build issues ([#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/5)). Environment configuration was also improved by updating the `.gitignore` to exclude local environment files and adding an `.env.example` file to serve as a template for developers ([#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/4)).

-   **New Feature Initiation**
    Work on new functionality has commenced with a pull request opened to implement worker functionality ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/2)).
