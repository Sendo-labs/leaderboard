# Sendo-labs/frontend Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October marked the inception of the Sendo-labs/frontend repository, establishing the project's foundational architecture and core functionalities. The month began with a comprehensive initial commit that laid out a component-driven structure and API client patterns. A significant strategic pivot occurred mid-month with a migration from a Vite+React setup to a Next.js 15 application. This architectural shift, which included adopting Bun and Biome, was undertaken to better support server-side data fetching and future data recovery strategies. Alongside these foundational changes, initial development began on integrating the Eliza API for agent and chat management.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month focused on establishing a robust foundation for the frontend application, including a major architectural migration to better suit the project's long-term goals.

### Project Initialization and Foundational Architecture
The project was officially kicked off with an initial commit that established a comprehensive codebase ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/1)). This included a vast library of UI components for agent management, marketplace features, and general use, indicating a component-driven approach from the start. Initial API client structures were also put in place, preparing for future backend communication.

### Architectural Migration to Next.js
A major refactoring effort was undertaken to migrate the application from Vite+React to Next.js 15. This change enhances the development environment by introducing Bun as the package manager and Biome for linting and formatting ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/1)). As part of this transition, the page structure was refactored to align with Next.js best practices, preparing the application for server-side data fetching from agents in future iterations ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/3)).

### Eliza Agent and Chat Integration
Initial work began on integrating core ElizaOS functionalities. This involved adding Eliza API dependencies and developing custom hooks (`useElizaAgent.js`, `useElizaChat.js`) to manage agent and chat interactions. To support this, essential UI components such as `AgentSidebar.jsx`, `ChatInterface.jsx`, and `AnimatedMarkdown.jsx` were created ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/2)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed in October.
- **New & Active Issues:** The repository saw no new or active issues this month. Development was concentrated on building out the initial codebase and defining the core architecture, with no reported bugs or feature requests from the community.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
As the project's inaugural month, activity was centered on foundational commits rather than broad community discussion. The provided reports do not indicate a high degree of discussion or multiple reviews on the initial pull requests, which is typical for the bootstrap phase of a new repository. All development appears to be focused on establishing the initial technical direction and structure.
