# Sendo-labs/frontend Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October marked the inception of the Sendo-labs/frontend repository, establishing the project's foundational codebase. The month was characterized by rapid architectural evolution, beginning with a comprehensive initial commit that included a vast UI component library and API structures. This was quickly followed by a significant migration from a Vite+React setup to a more robust Next.js 15 application using Bun. Concurrently, foundational work began on integrating the Eliza API, with the development of core hooks and components for agent and chat management, setting a strong technical direction for the project.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Development in October focused on establishing the project's architecture, core features, and developer environment.

-   **Project Initialization and Architectural Migration**
    The repository was born with an extensive initial commit that laid out a component-driven structure, including numerous UI elements and API client stubs ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/1)). Shortly after, a major refactoring effort migrated the entire project from Vite+React to Next.js 15, adopting Bun as the package manager and Biome for code formatting ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/1), [#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/3)). This pivot also involved restructuring pages to align with Next.js best practices for future data recovery strategies.

-   **Eliza Agent and Chat Functionality**
    Foundational work for the core user experience began with the integration of Eliza API dependencies. To manage agent and chat interactions, new custom hooks (`useElizaAgent.js`, `useElizaChat.js`) were created. This was complemented by the development of essential UI components, including `AgentSidebar.jsx`, `ChatInterface.jsx`, and `AnimatedMarkdown.jsx`, to build out the agent interface ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/2)).

-   **Infrastructure and Maintenance**
    To ensure project stability and streamline the developer workflow, key maintenance tasks were completed. Missing dependencies were added to resolve build issues ([#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/5)). Environment configuration was also refined by creating an `.env.example` template and updating `.gitignore` to properly handle local environment files ([#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/4)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
-   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed in October.
-   **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened this month. Development was driven directly through pull requests, indicating that planning and task tracking may be occurring outside of GitHub Issues during this initial bootstrapping phase.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Activity this month was concentrated on a few large, foundational pull requests, suggesting that development is being led by a focused core team. There was no significant discussion noted on pull requests or issues, which is typical for a project in its initial setup phase where architectural decisions are being implemented directly. The work pattern reflects a period of intense, centralized effort to establish a solid technical groundwork for future community contributions.
