# Sendo-labs/frontend Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October marked the inception and rapid foundational development of the Sendo-labs/frontend project. The month began with the initial commit establishing the entire codebase and quickly evolved with a major architectural migration from Vite+React to Next.js 15. Development focused on implementing core functionalities essential to the Sendo mission, including a new worker system for agent tasks, an analyzer feature for trade analysis, and robust user authentication via Privy. This intensive period of building has laid a strong technical groundwork for the personal AI agent platform.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
This month's work centered on establishing the project's architecture and rolling out initial core features.

-   **Project Foundation and Architectural Migration**
    The repository was born with an initial commit that included a comprehensive set of UI components, API client structures, and project configurations ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/1)). Shortly after, a significant architectural decision was made to migrate the entire application from Vite+React to Next.js 15. This effort involved a major refactoring to align with Next.js best practices, update configurations, and improve the page structure for a better data recovery strategy, moving away from mocked data ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/1), [#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/3)).

-   **Worker System Implementation**
    A major focus was the implementation of the "worker" system. Initial work laid the groundwork for worker functionality, introducing new components and services ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/2)). This was followed by refinements to the worker plugin's `RuleBuilder` for better code clarity ([#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/6)), a refactor of the worker client to streamline polling logic and automate analysis suggestions ([#12](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/12)), and the addition of a worker creation feature ([#16](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/16)). A pull request for `worker-code` was also opened, indicating ongoing development in this area ([#14](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/14)).

-   **Agent and Analyzer Features**
    Progress on agent interaction was a key theme. The project integrated Eliza API dependencies and developed custom hooks (`useElizaAgent.js`, `useElizaChat.js`) to manage agent and chat functionalities ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/2)). The user-facing agent interface was enhanced by replacing the old `AgentPanel` with a new, more interactive `AgentChat` component ([#13](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/13)). Late in the month, the `merge-analyzer` feature was integrated, introducing client-side components and services for trade analysis ([#17](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/17)), with minor UI refinements to its error displays ([#18](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/18)).

-   **User Authentication**
    A critical step towards user management and security was taken with the integration of Privy for client-side and server-side authentication. This involved adding new dependencies, configurations, and dedicated logic for session handling, impacting numerous components to support the new authentication flows ([#10](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/10)).

-   **Code Health and Environment Stability**
    Throughout the month, there was a consistent effort to improve code quality and the development environment. This included adding missing dependencies to prevent build issues ([#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/5)), refining `.gitignore` and adding an `.env.example` for better environment management ([#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/4)), and extensive code reformatting for consistency and readability across agent, analyzer, and service files ([#11](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/11), [#15](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/15), [#16](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/16)). Dependencies like `@elizaos` were also updated ([#9](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/9)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
-   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed in October.
-   **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were reported, and there were no active issues with significant discussion. Development activity was tracked exclusively through pull requests, indicating a development phase focused on implementation rather than public bug tracking or feature requests.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
