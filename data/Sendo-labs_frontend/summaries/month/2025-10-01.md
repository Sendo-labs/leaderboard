# Sendo-labs/frontend Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October marked the genesis of the Sendo-labs/frontend project, beginning with a massive foundational commit that established the core application structure and a comprehensive UI component library. The month was defined by rapid architectural evolution, most notably a strategic migration from a Vite+React setup to Next.js 15. This pivotal change was undertaken to prepare for robust data recovery strategies and future integration of real user data. Following the migration, development shifted towards building out core agent functionalities with Eliza API integration and enhancing user experience through standardized layouts and a new onboarding flow.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month focused on establishing a strong technical foundation and building out initial features.

### Project Initialization and Architectural Migration
The project was officially launched with an initial commit that laid out the entire frontend application, including API client structures and an extensive set of UI components ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/1)). Shortly after, a significant refactoring effort migrated the entire codebase from Vite+React to Next.js 15. This move was aimed at leveraging Next.js's data fetching capabilities and aligning the project with a more robust structure for future development, specifically to move beyond mocked data ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/1), [#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/3)).

### Core Agent and Chat Functionality
Early development focused on integrating the Eliza API to power agent interactions. This involved adding core dependencies and creating custom hooks (`useElizaAgent.js`, `useElizaChat.js`) to manage agent and chat logic. To support this, essential UI components such as `AgentSidebar.jsx` and `ChatInterface.jsx` were also developed ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/2)).

### UI/UX Enhancements and Refinements
To create a more consistent user experience, a shared `PageWrapper` component was introduced and applied across key pages like `analyzer`, `leaderboard`, and `worker`. A new `onboarding` page was also created to guide new users ([#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/7)). The `worker-plugin`'s `RuleBuilder` component was refactored for improved code clarity and readability ([#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/6)). In a minor UI refinement, the 'accepted' status was removed from the `ActionHistory` component to simplify status handling ([#8](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/8)).

### Development Environment and Stability
Following the migration to Next.js, work was done to stabilize the development environment. This included adding missing dependencies to `package.json` to prevent build issues ([#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/5)) and refining the `.gitignore` and `.env.example` files for better management of local environment configurations ([#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/4)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The project is in its initial bootstrap phase, and development appears to be driven directly through pull requests rather than a formal issue-tracking process.

-   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed in October.
-   **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were reported, and there were no active issues with significant discussion during this period.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
As a new project, the development activity in October reflects a concentrated, foundational push. The provided data does not indicate broad community discussion or collaboration on issues or pull requests. The work completed suggests a focused effort by the initial development team to establish the project's architecture and core feature set.
