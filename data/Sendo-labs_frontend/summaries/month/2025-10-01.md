# Sendo-labs/frontend Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October marked the inception of the Sendo-labs/frontend project, establishing a comprehensive foundation for the ElizaOS agent framework. The month began with an initial, large-scale commit that laid out the core application structure and a vast UI component library. The most significant event was a strategic migration from a Vite+React stack to Next.js 15, a move designed to enhance server-side data handling and prepare for real-world agent interactions. Development quickly progressed to building out core agent and chat functionalities, standardizing UI layouts, and initiating work on a new worker feature, setting a rapid pace for the project's foundational phase.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
This month's work focused on establishing the project's architecture, migrating to a more robust framework, and beginning feature implementation.

- **Project Initialization and Core Structure**
  - The repository was born with its initial commit, which included a wide array of UI components for agent management and marketplace features, API client structures, and core application files ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/1)).
  - Shortly after, core Eliza API dependencies were integrated, and custom hooks (`useElizaAgent.js`, `useElizaChat.js`) were created to manage agent and chat state, alongside essential UI components like `ChatInterface.jsx` and `AgentSidebar.jsx` ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/2)).

- **Architectural Migration to Next.js 15**
  - A major refactoring effort saw the project migrate from Vite+React to a Next.js 15 application, adopting Bun as the package manager and Biome for linting and formatting ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/1)).
  - In line with this migration, the page structure was improved to better align with Next.js patterns, specifically to enable server-side data fetching from the agent and move away from mocked data ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/3)).

- **UI/UX Refinement and Feature Development**
  - To ensure a consistent user experience, a new `PageWrapper` component was introduced to standardize the layout across the `analyzer`, `leaderboard`, `worker`, and a new `onboarding` page ([#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/7)).
  - Work on a new worker implementation was initiated ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/2)), and the associated `worker-plugin` was later refactored to improve code clarity and readability ([#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/6)).

- **Dependency and Configuration Hygiene**
  - Essential maintenance was performed to stabilize the new project, including adding missing dependencies to prevent build issues ([#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/5)).
  - Environment configuration was improved by updating `.gitignore` to properly handle local environment files and adding an `.env.example` for guidance ([#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/4)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during October.
- **New & Active Issues:** No new or active issues were reported this month. Development appears to be driven by a planned roadmap executed through pull requests rather than by reactive bug fixing or community-reported issues.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
As the project's inaugural month, development activity was focused and appears to be driven by a core team. The daily reports do not indicate broad community discussion, multiple reviewers on pull requests, or contributions from new members. The work progressed in a linear fashion, from foundational setup to strategic refactoring, suggesting a well-coordinated effort to establish a strong technical base before expanding collaboration.
