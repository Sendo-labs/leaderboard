# Sendo-labs/frontend Daily Update (Oct 22, 2025)

## OVERVIEW
Today's development focused on enhancing page consistency and user experience with a new shared layout component and an onboarding flow. Significant refactoring also improved code readability and maintainability in the worker-plugin.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Page Structure and Onboarding Flow
A new shared `PageWrapper` component was introduced to standardize the layout of key pages, including `analyzer`, `leaderboard`, `worker`, and a new `onboarding` page. This ensures consistent styling and structure across the application, improving user experience. The new onboarding flow guides users through initial setup. ([#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/7))

### Worker Plugin Refinements
The `worker-plugin` underwent refactoring to improve code clarity and maintainability. Specifically, label elements within the `RuleBuilder` component were updated for better readability by breaking long lines, and formatting for label attributes was standardized across different rule types. ([#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/6))
