# Sendo-labs/frontend Daily Update (Oct 22, 2025)

## OVERVIEW
Today's development focused on enhancing page consistency and user experience with a new shared layout component and an onboarding flow. Significant refactoring also improved code readability in the worker plugin.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Page Structure and Onboarding Flow
A new `PageWrapper` component was introduced to provide consistent styling and structure across several main pages, including `analyzer`, `leaderboard`, `worker`, and the newly added `onboarding` page. This streamlines the user interface and prepares for a more guided user experience. ([#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/7))

### Worker Plugin Refinements
The worker plugin underwent refactoring to improve code clarity and maintainability. Specifically, label elements within the `RuleBuilder` component were updated for better readability, and formatting for label attributes was standardized across different rule types.
