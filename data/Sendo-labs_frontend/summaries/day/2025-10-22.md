## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on significant UI/UX improvements, including the introduction of a new `PageWrapper` component for consistent page layouts and the refactoring of the `worker-plugin` for enhanced readability and code clarity.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Page Layouts and New Onboarding Experience
A new `PageWrapper` component has been introduced to standardize the layout and styling across several main pages, including `analyzer`, `leaderboard`, `worker`, and the newly added `onboarding` page. This refactoring ensures a consistent user experience and streamlines future UI development. ([#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/7))

### Refactored Worker Plugin for Improved Readability
The `worker-plugin` has undergone a refactor to improve code clarity and maintainability. This includes updating label elements in the `RuleBuilder` component for better readability by breaking long lines and ensuring consistent formatting for label attributes across different rule types.
