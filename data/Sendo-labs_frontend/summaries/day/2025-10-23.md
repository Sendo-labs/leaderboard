# Sendo-labs/frontend Daily Update (Oct 23, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on implementing a new worker system, enhancing the frontend architecture, and refining UI components. Key updates include a significant feature addition for worker implementation and a refactor to simplify action status handling.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Worker Implementation and Core Feature Expansion
A major feature, "worker implementation," was added, introducing new components and services related to worker functionality. This involved extensive changes across `src/app`, `src/components`, `src/lib`, and `src/services`, laying the groundwork for enhanced agent capabilities. ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/2))

### UI Refinements and Dependency Updates
The `ActionHistory` component was refactored to remove the 'accepted' status, streamlining action status handling and improving UI clarity. Additionally, `@elizaos` dependencies were updated to version 1.6.3, ensuring the project uses the latest compatible libraries.
