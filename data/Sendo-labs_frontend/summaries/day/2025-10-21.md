# Sendo-labs/frontend Daily Update (Oct 21, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The frontend repository saw updates focused on development environment stability and configuration. Key changes include adding missing dependencies to prevent build issues and refining `.gitignore` to manage environment files effectively.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Development Environment Configuration
- Updated `.gitignore` to include specific environment files (`.env.local`, `.env.development.local`, etc.) for better local configuration management, while ensuring the base `.env` file remains ignored to protect sensitive information. ([#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/4))
- Created an `.env.example` file to provide a template for environment variables. ([#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/4))

### Dependency Management
- Added critical missing dependencies to `package.json` and updated `bun.lock` to resolve potential build issues. ([#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/5))
