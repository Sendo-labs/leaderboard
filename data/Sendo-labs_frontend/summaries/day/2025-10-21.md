# Sendo-labs/frontend Daily Update (Oct 21, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on essential maintenance, including dependency management to prevent build issues and refining `.gitignore` for better environment file handling.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Dependency Management
*   Added missing dependencies to `bun.lock` and `package.json` to resolve potential build issues. ([#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/5))

### Configuration File Management
*   Updated `.gitignore` to specifically exclude local environment files (`.env.local`, `.env.development.local`, etc.) while ensuring the base `.env` remains ignored. ([#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/4))
*   Created an `.env.example` file to provide a sample for environment configurations. ([#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/4))
