## OVERVIEW 
The Sendo-labs/frontend repository saw significant progress today with the introduction of a new agent chat feature, enhancements to agent creation, and a major refactoring of the worker client and analysis handling for improved data fetching and user experience.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Agent Interaction and Creation
A new `AgentChat` component has replaced the older `AgentPanel`, providing a richer interactive experience for agent chat functionality [#13](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/13). Additionally, improvements were made to the agent creation process, including indentation adjustments, simplified prop destructuring, and enhanced formatting for better clarity and readability [#11](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/11).

### Streamlined Worker Analysis and Data Handling
The worker analysis and actions workflow underwent a significant refactoring. This included streamlining polling logic, improving waiting states for users, and removing the manual "suggest" button in favor of automatic polling for analysis [#12](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/12). This refactor also involved updating the worker client and analysis handling to improve data fetching and remove deprecated components.
