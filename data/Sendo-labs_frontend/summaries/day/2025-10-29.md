# Sendo-labs/frontend Daily Update (Oct 29, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the worker creation process and improving code readability and consistency across several core files. A new feature for worker creation was added, alongside significant formatting standardization.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Worker Creation Feature
A new feature for worker creation was introduced, involving updates to `src/app/worker/page.tsx` and `src/services/kenny.service.ts`. This enhancement is part of the ongoing development to allow users to create their own AgentAI. ([#16](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/16))

### Code Readability and Formatting Standardization
Significant effort was put into improving code readability and standardizing formatting across various files. This included:
- Removing unnecessary blank lines in `createChatAgent` and `getChatAgent` functions.
- Standardizing indentation in `create.ts` and `use-eliza-agent.ts`.
- Ensuring consistent formatting in `use-eliza-client.ts` and `utils.t`.
These changes were applied to files within `src/actions`, `src/hooks`, and `src/services`. ([#16](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/16))
