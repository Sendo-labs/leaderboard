## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Worker Creation Feature and Code Standardization
A new feature for worker creation was introduced, which involved updates to multiple files related to agent and chat creation. This update also included a significant effort to standardize code formatting, remove unnecessary blank lines, and ensure consistent indentation across `create.ts`, `use-eliza-agent.ts`, `use-eliza-client.ts`, and `utils.t` files.
