# Sendo-labs/frontend Daily Update (Oct 19, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on a significant migration from React to Next.js 15, enhancing the project's structure and preparing for a robust data recovery strategy. This foundational work sets the stage for integrating real user data from agents.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Project Migration and Configuration Update
The project underwent a major refactoring, migrating from a Vite+React application to a Next.js 15 application. This included updating configurations, introducing Biome for linting and formatting, and restructuring the overall project to align with Next.js best practices. This foundational change impacts nearly all aspects of the frontend. ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/1))

### Enhanced Page Structure for Data Recovery
The page structure was significantly improved to anticipate a better data recovery strategy. This refactoring aligns with Next.js best practices for data fetching, preparing the application to integrate real user data from agents, moving beyond the current use of mocked data.
