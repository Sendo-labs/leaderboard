# Sendo-labs/frontend Daily Update (Oct 19, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The frontend project saw significant refactoring today, migrating from React to Next.js 15 and improving page structures for better data recovery. A new feature for worker implementation was also initiated.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Project Migration and Configuration Update
The project underwent a major refactoring, migrating from a Vite+React application to a Next.js 15 application using Bun as the package manager. This update also introduced Biome for linting and formatting, and revised the overall project structure and configuration files. ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/1))

### Enhanced Page Structure for Data Recovery
The page structure was improved to align with Next.js best practices, anticipating a more robust data recovery strategy. This refactoring prepares the application for fetching real user data from the agent on the server-side, moving away from mocked data. ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/3))
