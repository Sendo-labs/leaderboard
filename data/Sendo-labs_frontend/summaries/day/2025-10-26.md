## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Privy Authentication Integration
*   **Privy Authentication Added:** Implemented Privy authentication to support both client-side and server-side user authentication and session management. This involved adding Privy configuration, integrating necessary libraries, and updating several core components and utilities. ([#10](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/10))
    *   Modified `.env.example`, `bun.lock`, and `package.json` to include Privy dependencies and configurations.
    *   Updated `src/components/auth/login.tsx`, `src/components/auth/test-identity-token.tsx`, `src/components/navigation.tsx`, and `src/components/ui/button.tsx` to incorporate Privy authentication flows.
    *   Introduced new files `src/lib/auth/privy.ts` and `src/lib/auth/session.ts` for Privy-specific logic and session handling.
    *   Adjusted `src/lib/providers.tsx` and `src/lib/wrapper/with-action.ts` to integrate with the new authentication system.
    *   Added `src/types/actions.d.ts` to support new action types related to authentication.
