# Sendo-labs/frontend Daily Update (Oct 30, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on integrating the analyzer feature, significant code refactoring for consistency across agent environments, and minor refinements to the analyzer's display.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Analyzer Feature Integration
The `merge-analyzer` feature was successfully integrated, introducing new client-side components for the analyzer and worker, along with updated hooks and services for trade analysis and Eliza agent interaction. This includes files like `src/app/analyzer/client.tsx`, `src/components/analyzer/performance-metrics.tsx`, and `src/services/trades.service.ts`. ([#17](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/17))

### Agent Environment Code Refactoring
Extensive refactoring was performed across various action files to enhance code consistency, readability, and maintainability. This involved reformatting code, aligning indentation, updating comments, and ensuring consistent use of `async/await` syntax in files such as `src/actions/agents/create.ts`, `src/actions/analyzer/get.ts`, and `src/services/agent.service.ts`. ([#15](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/15))

### Analyzer Refinements
Minor refinements were made to the analyzer, specifically removing unnecessary line breaks in error message displays for improved readability and consistency. This change affected files like `src/actions/analyzer/get-trades.ts` and `src/app/analyzer/client.tsx`. ([#18](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/18))
