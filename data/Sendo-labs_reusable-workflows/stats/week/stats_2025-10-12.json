I’ve set up two different workflows: releasing for general projects and npm-publish specifically for plugins.\r\nAdditionally, I’ve added a CONTRIBUTING.md to guide contributors on how to contribute to this public repository.\r\n\r\n## How\r\n- Added reusable workflows in .github/workflows/.\r\n- Created a release workflow to manage different workflow versions.\r\n- Added documentation in each workflow folder, explaining the purpose of each reusable workflow and how to use it.\r\n- Included a minimal configuration for release-please.",
