# Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October marked the inception of the `reusable-workflows` repository. The primary focus was on establishing a foundational set of CI/CD tools to standardize and streamline development processes across Sendo's projects. This foundational work culminated in the successful creation and initial release of workflows for general project releases and npm package publishing, setting a critical baseline for future automation and deployment efficiency.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
All development this month centered on establishing the initial infrastructure for reusable workflows.

-   **Initial Workflow and Release Management Setup**
    The project was kickstarted with the implementation of core reusable workflows. A foundational pull request introduced configurations for both general project releases and npm package publishing, designed to streamline future deployment processes ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows/pull/1)). Following this setup, the first official versions of these workflows were released as v1.0.0, making them available for use ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows/pull/2), [#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows/pull/3)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The repository saw no issue-related activity during this period.

-   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed in October.
-   **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were reported, and there were no ongoing discussions on active issues.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Activity in October was concentrated on the initial, foundational setup of the repository. The work was completed in a focused manner, establishing the core functionality without extensive public discussion or external contributions, which is typical for a project's initial bootstrapping phase.
