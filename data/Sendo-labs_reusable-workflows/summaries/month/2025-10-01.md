# Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October marked the foundational setup of the `reusable-workflows` repository. The primary focus was on establishing robust release automation from the outset. Key achievements include the creation and implementation of reusable workflows for general project releases and npm-specific publishing. This foundational work culminated in the successful automated release of version 1.0.0, establishing a critical automation pipeline for all future development within the ElizaOS ecosystem.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
All development this month centered on creating the initial set of CI/CD workflows for release management.

- **Initial Workflow and Release Management Setup:** Foundational work was completed to introduce core reusable workflows for automating release processes. This included the creation of a general release workflow and a specialized `npm-publish` workflow, configured to use `release-please` for versioning and changelog generation ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows/pull/1)). This effort provides a standardized and automated release mechanism for projects.

- **First Automated Release:** The newly created workflows were immediately put to use, successfully managing the initial automated releases for the repository. This process validated the release management system and resulted in the tagging of version 1.0.0 ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows/pull/2), [#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows/pull/3)).
