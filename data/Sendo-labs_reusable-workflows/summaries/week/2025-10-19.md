# Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows Weekly Report (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week marked the inception of the `reusable-workflows` project, with a focused effort on establishing foundational automation for release management. The core achievement was the creation and successful implementation of reusable workflows for both general and npm-specific releases. This initial setup was immediately validated by the automated release of version 1.0.0, proving the system's effectiveness and paving the way for streamlined development and deployment across the ElizaOS ecosystem.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The week's work was entirely focused on building the initial infrastructure for automated release processes.

*   **Initial Release Workflow Implementation:** Foundational work was completed to introduce a suite of reusable workflows for release management. This included a general-purpose release workflow and a specialized `npm-publish` workflow, configured with `release-please` to handle versioning and changelog generation automatically ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows/pull/1)). This new feature establishes the core functionality of the repository.
*   **First Automated Release:** The newly created workflows were immediately put to the test, successfully executing automated releases. This resulted in the creation of version 1.0.0, demonstrating that the release automation is fully operational from day one ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows/pull/2), [#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows/pull/3)).
