# Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows Weekly Report (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week marked the foundational launch of the reusable workflows project. The primary focus was on establishing a robust automation framework for release management and package publishing. Key workflows for versioning, releases, and npm publishing were created and immediately put to use. The week culminated in the successful automated release of version 1.0.0, establishing a solid baseline for future development and integration with other projects.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
### Initial Workflow Scaffolding and First Release
The project was initialized with the creation of core reusable workflows designed to streamline development and deployment processes. This foundational effort included:
-   **Workflow Setup**: The initial set of essential workflows, including `release.yml`, `npm-publish.yml`, and `rws-versioning.yml`, were configured and merged, providing the core automation logic for the repository ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows/pull/1)).
-   **Automated v1.0.0 Release**: The newly created workflows were immediately leveraged to perform the first automated release of the project. This process successfully tagged version 1.0.0 and updated the `CHANGELOG.md` and release manifest files, validating the new automation pipeline ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows/pull/2), [#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows/pull/3)).
