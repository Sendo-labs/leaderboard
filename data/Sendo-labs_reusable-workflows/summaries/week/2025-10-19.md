# Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows Weekly Report (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week marked the inception of the `reusable-workflows` project, with a singular focus on establishing a robust foundation for automated CI/CD processes. The core achievement was the creation and immediate release of the initial set of reusable workflows. This foundational work included workflows for general project releases and npm package publishing, culminating in the successful release of version 1.0.0 for both, setting the stage for streamlined deployments across Sendo-labs projects.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
All development this week centered on the initial setup and release of the core workflows.

- **Initial Workflow Implementation and Release**
The primary effort was to establish the repository's core functionality. The foundational workflows for handling general project releases and publishing npm packages were implemented and merged ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows/pull/1)). Immediately following this setup, the first official versions (v1.0.0) of the general release workflow ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows/pull/3)) and the npm-publish workflow ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows/pull/2)) were tagged and released, marking a significant milestone for the new repository.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The issue tracker was quiet this week, which is typical for a project in its initial setup phase. No new issues were opened, and there were no existing issues to close or discuss.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
