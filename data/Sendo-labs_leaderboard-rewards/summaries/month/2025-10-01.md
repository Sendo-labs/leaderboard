# Sendo-labs/leaderboard-rewards Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October marked the foundational development phase for the leaderboard rewards system. The primary focus was the rapid implementation of an automated contributor rewards mechanism, centered around a new oracle bot. This system was designed to ensure fair and scalable compensation by integrating with a leaderboard API to fetch contributor XP and synchronize rewards. In just two days, the project went from initiating the concept in a pull request to deploying the core infrastructure, including the bot, supporting workflows, and a comprehensive testing framework.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Development this month was concentrated on establishing the core functionality of the repository through a single, significant pull request.

-   **Automated Contributor Reward System & Oracle Bot:** The main achievement was the introduction of an oracle bot to automate the distribution of rewards to open-source contributors. This bot fetches XP data from the leaderboard API and handles the reward synchronization process. This work, completed in PR [#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard-rewards/pull/1), also included the setup of foundational repository infrastructure, such as GitHub workflows for security audits and testing, configuration files for Anchor and Cargo, and ignore files (`.gitignore`, `.prettierignore`). To support development, several new scripts (`claim-sbt.ts`, `create-epoch.ts`, `initialize.ts`) and a full testing suite for the oracle bot were also established.
