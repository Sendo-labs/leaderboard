# Sendo-labs/leaderboard-rewards Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October marked the foundational launch of the `leaderboard-rewards` project. Development was concentrated on a single, significant push that established the entire core infrastructure for automating open-source contributor rewards. The centerpiece of this work is a new oracle bot designed to fetch contributor XP from the leaderboard API and synchronize rewards, ensuring a scalable and verifiable distribution process. This initial commit also laid the groundwork for future development by defining the project structure, implementing testing frameworks, and providing essential documentation.
