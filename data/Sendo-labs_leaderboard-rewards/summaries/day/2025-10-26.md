# Sendo-labs/leaderboard-rewards Daily Update (Oct 26, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on a significant infrastructure addition: an oracle bot designed to automate contributor reward distribution. This bot integrates with the leaderboard API to fetch XP and syncs rewards, addressing scalability and verifiability challenges in recognizing OSS contributions.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Automated Contributor Reward System Implemented
A major new component, an oracle bot, has been introduced to automate the process of rewarding open-source contributors. This bot fetches contributor XP data from the leaderboard API and synchronizes rewards, aiming to provide fair and transparent compensation. This work involved extensive file additions across the repository, particularly within the `oracle-bot/src` and `oracle-bot/__tests__` directories, indicating a comprehensive implementation and testing effort. ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard-rewards/pull/1))

### Core Infrastructure and Scripting Updates
The implementation of the reward system necessitated updates to core infrastructure files, including workflow definitions for security audits and testing, as well as project configuration files like `Cargo.toml` and `package.json`. Additionally, new scripts were added to manage various aspects of the reward process, such as claiming SBTs, creating epochs, and funding USDC, reflecting a holistic approach to supporting the new reward mechanism.
