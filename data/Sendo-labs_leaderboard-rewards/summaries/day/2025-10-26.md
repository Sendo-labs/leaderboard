# Sendo-labs/leaderboard-rewards Daily Update (Oct 26, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on a significant infrastructure addition: an oracle bot designed to automate contributor reward distribution. This bot integrates with the leaderboard API to fetch XP and sync rewards, addressing scalability and verifiability challenges in recognizing OSS contributions.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Automated Contributor Reward System Implemented
A major new component, an oracle bot, has been introduced to automate the process of rewarding open-source contributors. This bot fetches contributor XP data from the leaderboard API and synchronizes rewards, aiming to provide fair and transparent compensation. This work involved extensive changes across the repository, including new workflows, configuration files, and core bot logic. ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard-rewards/pull/1))

### Core Oracle Bot Logic and Testing
Significant development occurred within the `oracle-bot/src` directory, where the core logic for the oracle bot was implemented. This includes client interactions, configuration management, leaderboard data fetching, logging, monitoring, and the central oracle functionality. Comprehensive testing was also a key focus, with new test files added in `oracle-bot/__tests__` to ensure the reliability and correctness of the bot's operations, covering endpoint, integration, and leaderboard interactions.

### Scripting and Program Infrastructure Updates
Several new scripts were added to support various functionalities, including claiming SBTs, creating epochs, funding USDC, initializing processes, and minting and funding tokens. These scripts are crucial for interacting with the reward system. Additionally, updates were made to the `programs/leaderboard-rewards` directory, indicating modifications to the underlying reward program's structure and functionality.
