# Sendo-labs/leaderboard-rewards Daily Update (Oct 26, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on a significant infrastructure addition: an oracle bot designed to automate contributor reward distribution. This bot integrates with the leaderboard API to fetch XP and manage reward syncing, addressing scalability and verifiability challenges in rewarding OSS contributors.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Automated Contributor Reward System Implemented
A major new system has been introduced to automate the rewarding of open-source contributors. This includes the development of an oracle bot that fetches contributor XP from the leaderboard API and synchronizes rewards, significantly improving the transparency and scalability of the reward distribution process. This work involved extensive changes across the `oracle-bot/src`, `oracle-bot/__tests__`, and `scripts` directories. ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard-rewards/pull/1))

### Core Infrastructure and Testing Framework Established
The repository now includes foundational infrastructure elements such as workflow configurations for security audits and testing, along with comprehensive test suites for the newly developed oracle bot. This establishes a robust framework for future development and ensures code quality and reliability. ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard-rewards/pull/1))

### Documentation and Project Structure Defined
Initial project documentation, including cost optimization, deployment checklists, integration guides, and specifications, has been added. This provides essential guidance for understanding and interacting with the project. The overall project structure, including `indexer`, `programs/leaderboard-rewards`, and `scripts` directories, has also been defined. ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard-rewards/pull/1))
