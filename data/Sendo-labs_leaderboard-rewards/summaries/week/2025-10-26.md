# Sendo-labs/leaderboard-rewards Weekly Report (Oct 26 - 1, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week marked the foundational launch of the leaderboard rewards project. The primary focus was on establishing the core infrastructure for automating open-source contributor rewards. A significant new oracle bot was developed to fetch contributor XP from the leaderboard API and synchronize rewards, addressing key challenges of scalability and verifiability. This initial push also included the setup of essential testing frameworks, security workflows, and comprehensive project documentation, laying a robust groundwork for future development.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
All development this week was consolidated into a single, comprehensive effort that established the project's initial structure and core functionality.

- **Automated Contributor Reward System Established**
  The cornerstone of this week's work was the implementation of an automated system for rewarding contributors. An oracle bot was created to connect with the leaderboard API, fetch contributor XP data, and manage the reward syncing process. This new feature, introduced in PR [#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard-rewards/pull/1), is designed to improve the transparency and scalability of reward distribution. The work included extensive development in the `oracle-bot/src` and `scripts` directories, along with a full test suite in `oracle-bot/__tests__`.

- **Foundational Infrastructure and Documentation**
  Alongside the oracle bot, the project's core infrastructure was defined. This included setting up workflow configurations for security audits and testing to ensure code quality from the outset. Initial project documentation was also created, providing guides for integration, deployment checklists, and cost optimization strategies. The overall repository structure, including the `indexer` and `programs/leaderboard-rewards` directories, was also established as part of this foundational work ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard-rewards/pull/1)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed this week.
- **New & Active Issues:** The project began with a clean slate, as no new issues were reported and there were no active issues requiring attention.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week's activity was characterized by a focused, foundational effort encapsulated in a single, large-scale pull request ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard-rewards/pull/1)). This suggests a concerted push by the core team to initialize the repository with a complete, working foundation for the contributor rewards system.
