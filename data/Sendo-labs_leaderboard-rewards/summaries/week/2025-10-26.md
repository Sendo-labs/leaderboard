# Sendo-labs/leaderboard-rewards Weekly Report (Oct 26 - 1, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's development was centered on a significant infrastructure enhancement with the introduction of an oracle bot designed to automate contributor rewards. This new system addresses scalability and verifiability by integrating directly with the leaderboard API to fetch contributor XP and synchronize reward distributions. The work represents a foundational step towards creating a fair, transparent, and automated compensation mechanism for open-source contributions, aligning with the project's core philosophy of decentralization and open collaboration.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments

### New Feature: Automated Contributor Reward System
A major effort was dedicated to building and implementing an oracle bot to automate the entire contributor reward lifecycle. The goal is to provide scalable and verifiable compensation for community contributions.

- **Oracle Bot Implementation:** The core logic for the new oracle bot was developed, including client interactions, configuration management, leaderboard data fetching, logging, and monitoring. This work, consolidated in PR [#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard-rewards/pull/1), establishes the foundation for the automated reward system.
- **Testing and Reliability:** Comprehensive tests were added to ensure the bot's correctness and reliability, covering endpoint, integration, and leaderboard interactions.
- **Supporting Infrastructure:** To support the new system, several scripts were created for essential functions like claiming SBTs, creating epochs, and managing token funding. Updates were also made to the underlying `leaderboard-rewards` program to accommodate the new functionality.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed in this period.
- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened, and there were no significant discussions on existing issues reported.
