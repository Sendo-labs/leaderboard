# Overall Project Monthly Summary (October 2025)

This summary provides a high-level overview of major themes, accomplishments, and strategic direction for the ElizaOS project in October 2025.

## Executive Summary
October was a month of strategic expansion, with the launch of two new foundational projects. We kicked off development on a community leaderboard and a Web3-focused plugin, laying the essential groundwork to enhance our analytics capabilities and integrate deeper into the decentralized ecosystem.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Expanding the ElizaOS Ecosystem with New Capabilities**
*This initiative focuses on broadening the framework's functionality to support our core mission of creating adaptable, community-driven AI agents that operate across Web2 and Web3.*
-   The foundation was laid for a new community analytics platform with the creation of the [Sendo-labs/leaderboard](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard) repository. This initial work establishes a system for tracking contributor activity, a key step toward building a full-featured leaderboard.
-   We began development of a new Web3 tool with the inception of the [Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore) repository. This plugin will equip ElizaOS agents with the ability to analyze cryptocurrency tokens and wallets, directly advancing our goal of thriving in the Web3 ecosystem.

## Repository Spotlights

### Sendo-labs/leaderboard
October marked the beginning of the leaderboard project, with all efforts focused on establishing its core foundation.
-   The initial framework for tracking contributor activity was implemented, creating the essential backend for future analytics and leaderboard features ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/1)).

### Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore
This new repository was created to integrate cryptocurrency analysis into ElizaOS, starting with its foundational implementation.
-   The initial version of the plugin was developed, providing the core ability to retrieve scores for cryptocurrency tokens and wallets by connecting to the external CryptoScore API ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/1)).
