# Overall Project Monthly Summary (October 2025)

## Executive Summary
October was a foundational month for Sendo, marking the inception of our core platform and key plugins. We rapidly established the architectural groundwork for our AI agent framework, from the backend API and frontend application to essential data analysis plugins and development infrastructure, setting a powerful trajectory for the project.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Building the Core Sendo Platform**
*To bring our vision to life, we focused on creating the foundational frontend and backend systems that will power the entire Sendo experience.*
-   The core user interface was established in [Sendo-labs/frontend](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend), including a strategic migration to Next.js 15 to better support real-time agent interactions and server-side data handling.
-   A powerful backend was launched in [Sendo-labs/sendo-api](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api), featuring a comprehensive system for decoding a wide variety of blockchain transactions and integrating with key data services.
-   Initial work began in [Sendo-labs/spotlight](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/spotlight) to implement core Solana transaction logic, a critical step for enabling direct Web3 interactions.

**Expanding Agent Capabilities with Modular Plugins**
*In line with our philosophy of modularity, we began building specialized plugins to give our AI agents powerful, specific skills.*
-   The [Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker) was created, introducing a core orchestrator that allows agents to dynamically analyze their own capabilities and receive LLM-powered recommendations.
-   The [Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore) was launched to provide agents with the ability to retrieve and analyze token and wallet scores, a key data point for trading intelligence.

**Establishing Professional Development & Community Infrastructure**
*To ensure we can build and scale effectively, we created shared infrastructure for automated releases and community contribution tracking.*
-   A central repository for [Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows) was established to standardize and automate our release processes across all projects, culminating in its first official release.
-   The [Sendo-labs/leaderboard](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard) project was initiated to create a contributor tracking system, laying the groundwork for recognizing and encouraging community collaboration.

### Cross-Repository Coordination

This month saw significant coordination to ensure our new repositories work together as a cohesive platform. The `frontend` was built to consume services from the `sendo-api` and interact with plugins like the `plugin-sendo-worker`. Meanwhile, foundational infrastructure from `reusable-workflows` was immediately adopted by `plugin-cryptoscore` to automate its release pipeline, demonstrating our commitment to modular and efficient development from day one.

## Repository Spotlights

### Sendo-labs/frontend
-   Established the initial project structure with a comprehensive UI component library and migrated the entire application from Vite+React to Next.js 15 for enhanced performance and data handling ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/1)).
-   Integrated core Eliza API dependencies and created custom hooks to manage agent and chat state, forming the backbone of the user-agent interaction model ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/2)).
-   Standardized the layout across all pages by introducing a `PageWrapper` component, ensuring a consistent user experience ([#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/7)).
-   Improved the page structure to align with Next.js patterns, enabling server-side data fetching and moving away from mocked data ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/3)).

### Sendo-labs/sendo-api
-   Launched the project with a massive foundational commit that established the entire API structure, including controllers for trades and transactions, and integrations with Birdeyes and Helius ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/1)).
-   Implemented a robust suite of utilities for decoding transactions from numerous protocols, including Jupiter, Raydium, and Orca, providing a critical on-chain analysis capability ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/1)).
-   Quickly identified and resolved a critical bug affecting buy and sell operations, hardening the core trading functionality ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/3)).
-   Improved project accessibility by translating the README file into English for a global audience ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/2)).

### Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker
-   Launched the plugin with the implementation of the core Sendo Worker orchestrator, which enables dynamic analysis of agent capabilities and generates LLM-powered recommendations ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/1)).
-   Initiated work on a comprehensive test infrastructure to ensure the reliability and quality of the new orchestrator features ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/2)).

### Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore
-   Established the plugin's core functionality, enabling AI agents to retrieve token and wallet scores via the CryptoScore API ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/1)).
-   Implemented automated release management and NPM publishing workflows, creating a professional and reliable deployment pipeline from the project's inception ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/2)).
-   Prepared the project for its first official release, including configuration updates to align with the `@sendo-labs` package scope ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/3), [#8](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/8)).

### Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows
