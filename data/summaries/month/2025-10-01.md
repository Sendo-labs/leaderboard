# Overall Project Monthly Summary (October 2025)

## Executive Summary
October was a pivotal month of creation for ElizaOS, with the launch of six new core repositories that form the bedrock of our ecosystem. Foundational work across the board established the essential architecture for our frontend, backend API, agent capabilities, and developer infrastructure, setting a strong stage for future growth and innovation.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Establishing Core Web3 Data and Transaction Services**
To empower our AI agents with the ability to understand and process on-chain activities, we built the foundational services for Web3 data interaction.
-   The foundational `sendo-api` was launched, including a powerful system for decoding transactions from key protocols like Jupiter, Raydium, and Orca ([Sendo-labs/sendo-api](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api)).
-   The new `plugin-cryptoscore` was created, enabling agents to retrieve token and wallet scores by integrating with the CryptoScore API ([Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore)).

**Building the Foundation for the ElizaOS User Experience**
To create the primary interface where users will interact with our AI agents, we established the core architecture for our frontend application.
-   The `frontend` application was initialized, featuring a strategic migration to Next.js 15 to better support future server-side features and complex data handling ([Sendo-labs/frontend](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend)).
-   Initial integration work began on the `frontend` to connect with the Eliza API, paving the way for users to manage agents and chats directly through the interface ([Sendo-labs/frontend](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend)).

**Enabling Agent Action in the Web3 Ecosystem**
To move beyond data analysis and give agents the ability to perform actions—a core step towards autonomy—we began building their transactional capabilities.
-   Development was initiated on SOL transfer logic within the `spotlight` project, laying the groundwork for agents to execute on-chain transactions ([Sendo-labs/spotlight](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/spotlight)).

**Creating Infrastructure for Open-Source Collaboration and Growth**
To ensure our development process is efficient, automated, and transparent as the project and community scale, we created essential internal tooling.
-   The `reusable-workflows` repository was established to standardize and automate our development lifecycle across the organization ([Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows)).
-   The `leaderboard` project was launched with an initial contributor tracking system to provide visibility into ecosystem-wide contributions ([Sendo-labs/leaderboard](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard)).

## Repository Spotlights

### Sendo-labs/frontend
-   Kicked off the project with an initial commit establishing a comprehensive component-driven architecture and API client patterns ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/1)).
-   Undertook a strategic migration from Vite+React to Next.js 15, adopting Bun and Biome to better support future server-side data fetching requirements ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/1), [#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/3)).
-   Began integrating the Eliza API by adding dependencies and creating custom hooks and UI components for agent and chat management ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/2)).

### Sendo-labs/sendo-api
-   Launched the project with a comprehensive initial commit that established the entire service architecture, including controllers, service integrations for Birdeye and Helius, and a robust transaction decoding system for protocols like Jupiter, Meteora, and Raydium ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/1)).
-   Began work on project documentation with an update to the `README.md` file ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/2)).

### Sendo-labs/leaderboard
-   Initialized the contributor tracking system to establish the core analytics pipeline for the leaderboard's function ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/1)).
-   Expanded the tracker's scope by adding new repositories to the configuration, ensuring comprehensive activity monitoring from the start ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/2)).

### Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore
-   Established the plugin's foundational architecture, enabling agents to retrieve token and wallet scores by integrating directly with the CryptoScore API ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/1)).

### Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows
-   Initiated the project with a pull request to establish workflow and release management processes, creating the foundation for an automated development lifecycle ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows/pull/1)).

### Sendo-labs/spotlight
-   Began development on the core logic for handling SOL transfers, including corresponding unit tests, marking the first step towards enabling agent-driven transactions ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/spotlight/pull/1)).
