# Overall Project Monthly Summary (October 2025)

## Executive Summary
October was a month of genesis for Sendo, defined by a massive foundational push across the entire project stack. We successfully launched numerous core componentsâ€”from on-chain data APIs and intelligent agent plugins to the user-facing frontend and community reward systems. This foundational work establishes the key pillars of our personal AI agent platform, setting a rapid pace for future innovation.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Laying the Groundwork for the Sendo Ecosystem**
*To bring our vision to life, this month was dedicated to building the foundational pillars of our platform, from user-facing applications to the core on-chain services that will power our AI agents.*
-   The initial version of the **Sendo API** was launched, providing essential utilities for decoding on-chain transactions from major protocols like Jupiter, Orca, and Raydium ([Sendo-labs/sendo-api](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api)).
-   The **Frontend** project was kicked off with a core application structure and a strategic migration to Next.js 15, preparing the application for future data-intensive features and real user data integration ([Sendo-labs/frontend](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend)).
-   Development began on **Spotlight**, our on-chain interaction platform, with initial work on implementing core Solana transfer logic ([Sendo-labs/spotlight](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/spotlight)).

**Building Modular and Intelligent Agent Capabilities**
*To fulfill our vision of autonomous and adaptable AI, we are creating a modular ecosystem of plugins that give agents specialized skills for on-chain analysis and trading.*
-   The **Sendo Worker** plugin was implemented, creating an orchestrator that uses an LLM-powered engine to analyze data and generate intelligent trading recommendations ([Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker)).
-   The new **Sendo Analyser** plugin was launched, providing a dedicated and scalable service for comprehensive wallet and transaction analysis ([Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser)).
-   The **CryptoScore** plugin was created, enabling agents to retrieve token and wallet risk scores by integrating with the CryptoScore API ([Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore)).

**Establishing Robust Infrastructure for Scalable Development**
*To accelerate development and ensure project stability, we invested in creating automated, reusable workflows for building, testing, and releasing software across our projects.*
-   A new **Reusable Workflows** repository was created to centralize and standardize CI/CD processes for releases and package publishing across the organization ([Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows)).
-   The deployment process in the **Solana Plugin** was overhauled to create a more modular and controllable release pipeline, improving our ability to ship updates reliably ([Sendo-labs/plugin-solana](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-solana)).
-   Automated release and NPM publishing workflows were established for new plugins, ensuring that new versions and features can be delivered to the ecosystem efficiently ([Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore)).

**Fostering Open-Source Collaboration**
*To encourage community-driven progress and align with our core philosophy, we built the foundational systems to track contributions and automate rewards for our open-source contributors.*
-   The **Leaderboard** project was initiated to track contributor activity, with new API endpoints created to make this data accessible to other applications ([Sendo-labs/leaderboard](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard)).
-   An automated **Leaderboard Rewards** system was developed, featuring an oracle bot that synchronizes contributor XP from the leaderboard with on-chain rewards ([Sendo-labs/leaderboard-rewards](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard-rewards)).

### Cross-Repository Coordination
This month saw significant integration efforts as we built out the platform's core architecture. The functionality of the original `sendo-api` was successfully migrated into the new, more modular `plugin-sendo-analyser`, demonstrating our commitment to a composable architecture. In parallel, our new community-focused systems were built to work together from day one: the `leaderboard-rewards` system was designed to directly consume data from the `leaderboard` API, creating a seamless link between contribution and compensation.
