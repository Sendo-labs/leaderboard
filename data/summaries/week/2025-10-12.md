# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)
This week marked a major milestone for ElizaOS as we began building the user-facing application for our AI agent framework. Foundational work on the new frontend was completed, establishing the core architecture, API connections, and initial user interface components. This effort transforms our vision from a backend concept into a tangible product, laying the groundwork for all future user interaction with our AI agents.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Building the User Interface for AI Agents**
This initiative is critical for making our AI agent framework accessible and usable, providing the primary way for users to interact with and manage AI agents.
- The foundational structure for the new web application was established, including the necessary configurations and connections to communicate with the backend Eliza API ([Sendo-labs/frontend](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend)).
- The first key interface elements were built, including the agent sidebar and chat window, which will form the core of the user experience for agent interaction ([Sendo-labs/frontend](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend)).

## Repository Spotlights

### Sendo-labs/frontend
- The entire frontend application was bootstrapped in a single, comprehensive effort, establishing the project structure, API clients, and core UI components like the `AgentSidebar` and `ChatInterface` needed for users to interact with AI agents ([Sendo-labs/frontend#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/2)).
