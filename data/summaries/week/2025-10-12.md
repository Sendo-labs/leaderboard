# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week marked a significant milestone for ElizaOS with the foundational launch of two cornerstone projects: our primary user interface and our core Web3 API. This parallel effort establishes the essential technical groundwork for both how users will interact with our agents and how those agents will understand and operate within decentralized ecosystems.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Laying the Foundation for the ElizaOS Ecosystem**
This initiative focuses on building the core technical infrastructure that will power the entire agent framework, from the user-facing application to the backend services.
-   The new **`sendo-api`** repository was launched, establishing a backend service capable of interpreting complex on-chain data by integrating with services like Birdeye and Helius ([Sendo-labs/sendo-api](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api)).
-   The **`frontend`** application was created, delivering the initial project structure and essential UI components for managing agent and chat interactions ([Sendo-labs/frontend](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend)).

**Enabling On-Chain Agent Capabilities**
To achieve our vision of autonomous agents in Web3, we must equip them with the ability to understand and execute blockchain transactions.
-   Development began on the core logic for executing Solana (SOL) transfers, a critical first step toward enabling agents to perform on-chain actions ([Sendo-labs/spotlight](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/spotlight)).
-   The new `sendo-api` was built with robust utilities to decode transactions from a wide range of protocols (including Jupiter, Meteora, and Raydium), providing agents with the awareness needed to operate in complex DeFi environments ([Sendo-labs/sendo-api](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api)).

## Repository Spotlights

### Sendo-labs/frontend
The repository was initialized this week, establishing the complete foundational structure for the user-facing application.
-   The initial commit created the project's core framework, including essential UI components like `AgentSidebar.jsx` and `ChatInterface.jsx`, and integrated custom hooks (`useElizaAgent.js`, `useElizaChat.js`) for managing agent interactions ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/2)).

### Sendo-labs/spotlight
Work began on implementing core Web3 transaction functionality, focusing on enabling agents to interact with the Solana blockchain.
-   A new pull request was opened to introduce the logic for SOL transfers and its corresponding unit tests, marking the first concrete feature development in this area ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/spotlight/pull/1)).

### Sendo-labs/sendo-api
This week saw the inception of the Sendo API, with a single, comprehensive commit that established the entire backend architecture.
-   The project was initialized with its core structure, including API controllers, initial service integrations with Birdeye and Helius, and a powerful suite of utilities for decoding transactions from protocols like Jupiter, Orca, Pumpfun, and Raydium ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/1)).
