# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week marked the genesis of the ElizaOS project, with foundational work initiated across four new repositories. We established the core architecture for our AI agent framework, including the backend API, the user-facing frontend, and initial Web3 transaction capabilities, laying the groundwork for our mission to build autonomous, adaptable AI agents.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Establishing the Core AI Agent Framework**
*Strategic Importance: This initiative builds the heart of ElizaOS, creating the backend intelligence and the user-facing interface that allows agents to operate and be managed.*
-   The foundational backend was established in [Sendo-labs/sendo-api](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api), featuring a robust API and an extensive suite of tools for decoding a wide range of Web3 transactions.
-   The initial user interface was created in [Sendo-labs/frontend](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend), providing the essential components for users to interact with and manage AI agents.

**Enabling On-Chain Agent Actions**
*Strategic Importance: To empower agents with the ability to execute transactions and interact directly with Web3 ecosystems, a core part of our mission for agent autonomy.*
-   Work has begun in [Sendo-labs/spotlight](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/spotlight) to implement the logic for performing SOL transfers on the Solana blockchain.

**Building for Future Scale and Collaboration**
*Strategic Importance: To ensure our development processes are standardized and efficient, allowing the project to scale smoothly and welcome community contributions.*
-   The initial infrastructure for reusable development workflows and release management was initiated in [Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows).

### Cross-Repository Coordination
**Laying the Groundwork for an Integrated System**
While development occurred in separate repositories, the initial architecture was designed for integration. The new `frontend` was built from the start with dependencies for the `sendo-api`, ensuring the user interface and backend intelligence are aligned to function as a cohesive system from day one.

## Repository Spotlights

### Sendo-labs/sendo-api
-   Established the entire initial project structure, including API controllers and a comprehensive suite of utilities for decoding transactions from protocols like Jupiter, Meteora, and Raydium ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/1)).

### Sendo-labs/frontend
-   Created the foundational application, integrating Eliza API dependencies and building core UI components (`AgentSidebar.jsx`, `ChatInterface.jsx`) and state management hooks (`useElizaAgent.js`) for the agent experience ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/2)).

### Sendo-labs/spotlight
-   Initiated work on core Web3 capabilities by opening a pull request to add SOL transfer functionality and corresponding tests ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/spotlight/pull/1)).

### Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows
-   Began setting up the project's operational backbone by opening a pull request to implement initial workflow and release management systems ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows/pull/1)).
