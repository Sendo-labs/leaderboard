# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

This report provides a high-level strategic overview of the Sendo project's progress, synthesizing development activity across all repositories for the week of October 12 - 18, 2025.

## Executive Summary
This was a foundational week for Sendo, defined by the inception of three critical new projects. We launched the repositories for our backend API, frontend user interface, and on-chain agent framework, establishing the core architectural pillars that will support the entire platform. This coordinated first push lays the groundwork for building out Sendo's data analysis, user interaction, and trading capabilities.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Establishing the Core Platform Architecture**
*Goal: To build the essential backend services and user interface structure that will power the entire Sendo agent platform.*
-   The new Sendo API was launched to serve as the central data hub for analyzing on-chain activity. It was initialized with the ability to decode transactions from major Solana protocols like Jupiter, Raydium, and Orca ([Sendo-labs/sendo-api](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api)).
-   Development began on the ElizaOS frontend, creating the initial user interface components for agent and chat management that will allow users to interact with their AI agents ([Sendo-labs/frontend](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend)).

**Enabling On-Chain Agent Actions**
*Goal: To give AI agents the ability to execute trades and interact directly with blockchains, which is critical to our mission of building autonomous trading agents.*
-   Work began on the agent framework's first on-chain action: the ability to transfer SOL on the Solana network. This is the first step toward enabling agents to perform transactions independently ([Sendo-labs/spotlight](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/spotlight)).

## Repository Spotlights

### Sendo-labs/frontend
The frontend project was initiated this week, focusing on establishing the application's foundation.
-   The initial project structure was created, including core dependencies for the Eliza API and the first set of UI components for the agent sidebar and chat interface in [#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/2).

### Sendo-labs/spotlight
Development began on building the framework for on-chain agent actions, starting with the Solana ecosystem.
-   A pull request was opened to implement SOL transfer logic and corresponding unit tests, marking the first step in enabling agent-driven transactions ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/spotlight/pull/1)). This work is currently under review.

### Sendo-labs/sendo-api
The Sendo API repository was created and initialized with a comprehensive architecture to serve as the project's data backbone.
-   The foundational commit established the entire service structure, including API controllers for trades, NFTs, and tokens, as well as integrations with data providers like Birdeyes and Helius ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/1)).
-   A significant set of transaction decoding utilities was included from day one, providing support for protocols such as Jupiter, Meteora, Orca, Pumpfun, and Raydium.
