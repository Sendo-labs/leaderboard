# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week, we made significant strides in modernizing our technical foundations and expanding our core AI capabilities. We executed a major architectural overhaul of our frontend and laid the groundwork for two new plugins, including a dynamic analysis engine for agents. These efforts strengthen our framework's modularity and scalability, accelerating our path toward building more autonomous systems.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Modernizing Our Core Technology for Future Growth**
To ensure our platform is fast, scalable, and easy to build upon, we are upgrading our core technical foundations.
- The entire `frontend` was migrated to the modern Next.js 15 framework, a foundational shift that improves its potential for performance, scalability, and advanced data handling.
- The `sendo-api` became more reliable with a critical fix to its core buy/sell trading functionality, ensuring greater stability for users.

**Introducing a New Core for Agent Intelligence**
To advance our goal of creating autonomous AI agents, we are building the core components that allow them to analyze, reason, and act.
- The initial version of the `plugin-sendo-worker` was created, establishing a dynamic analysis engine designed to power agent recommendations and actions within the ElizaOS ecosystem.

**Automating Our Development and Release Processes**
To accelerate development and ensure consistent, reliable releases across all our projects, we are building a centralized automation system.
- A new repository, `reusable-workflows`, was launched to provide standardized, automated release workflows for the entire ElizaOS ecosystem, successfully publishing its first version.
- The `plugin-cryptoscore` adopted these new workflows to automate its release process, preparing it for its first public launch.

### Cross-Repository Coordination

**Standardizing Release Automation**
To create a single, reliable way to manage software releases across all our projects, we established a new central automation repository. The new `reusable-workflows` project was created to house these tools, and the `plugin-cryptoscore` team immediately adopted them to streamline its own deployment process, demonstrating the system's immediate value and our commitment to modular, efficient development.

## Repository Spotlights

### Sendo-labs/frontend
The frontend underwent a significant architectural overhaul to modernize its foundation and prepare for future feature development.
- Completed a major migration from Vite+React to Next.js 15, adopting Bun as the package manager to improve performance, scalability, and data handling capabilities ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/1)).
- Refactored page structures to align with Next.js best practices, setting the stage for more robust data recovery strategies ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/3)).
- Stabilized the new environment by resolving missing dependencies ([#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/5)) and improving environment configuration for developers ([#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/4)).
- Initiated work on a new worker implementation, opening a pull request for the new functionality ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/2)).

### Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker
This week saw the creation of a new, core component for the ElizaOS agent framework.
- The foundational implementation of the Sendo Worker was completed, introducing a dynamic analysis engine for agent capabilities. This work included core schemas, services, and a suite of LLM prompt templates to guide the agent's reasoning ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/1)).

### Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows
This new repository was created to centralize and streamline development processes across the organization.
- Established foundational workflows for automated release management using `release-please` and a specialized `npm-publish` workflow ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows/pull/1)).
- The new automation system was immediately validated by the successful, automated release of version 1.0.0 ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows/pull/2), [#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows/pull/3)).

### Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore
Work focused on preparing the plugin for its first public release by establishing a robust, automated deployment pipeline.
- Implemented new GitHub Actions workflows to automate release management, changelog generation, and publishing to NPM ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/2)).
- Refined workflow triggers and updated references to use the new `reusable-workflows`, improving maintainability ([#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/5), [#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/6)).
- Corrected the `package.json` configuration to ensure the package is properly scoped for distribution on NPM ([#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/7), [#8](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/8)).

### Sendo-labs/sendo-api
Efforts this week centered on improving stability and accessibility for the global community.
- Resolved a critical bug impacting buy and sell account operations, ensuring greater reliability in the core trading system ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/3)).
- Improved accessibility for international developers by adding a complete English translation of the main `README.md` file ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/2)).

### Sendo-labs/leaderboard
Development focused on foundational maintenance to expand the leaderboard's scope and data sources.
- Updated the pipeline configuration to track additional projects and repositories, ensuring the leaderboard remains comprehensive as the ecosystem grows ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/2), [#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/3)).
