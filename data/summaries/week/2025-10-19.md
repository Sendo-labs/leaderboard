# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)

This report provides a high-level strategic overview of the project's progress, focusing on major themes and outcomes from the past week.

## Executive Summary
This week was dedicated to significant foundational upgrades across the project, focusing on modernizing our frontend architecture and establishing automated systems for development and releases. These efforts are crucial for improving development velocity, ensuring platform stability, and preparing our infrastructure for future scalability and new features.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Modernizing the User-Facing Application**
*Goal: To enhance application performance, improve the developer experience, and lay the groundwork for more advanced, agent-driven features.*
- The entire frontend application was migrated to the modern Next.js 15 framework, a foundational shift that will enable faster page loads and server-side capabilities ([Sendo-labs/frontend](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend)).
- The application's page structure was refactored in preparation for a more robust strategy of fetching user data from AI agents directly on the server ([Sendo-labs/frontend](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend)).

**Automating Development and Release Processes**
*Goal: To streamline how we build and release software, ensuring consistency, reducing manual effort, and accelerating our ability to deliver value.*
- A new repository for shared, reusable automation was launched, and its workflows were immediately used to execute its own first automated v1.0.0 release ([Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows)).
- A fully automated release and publishing pipeline was built for the CryptoScore plugin, preparing it for a reliable and consistent launch schedule ([Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore)).

**Strengthening Core Systems and Documentation**
*Goal: To ensure our internal tools remain comprehensive and our projects are easy for the community to understand and contribute to.*
- The project leaderboard's tracking scope was expanded to include new repositories, ensuring its data remains comprehensive and relevant ([Sendo-labs/leaderboard](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard)).
- Work began on enhancing the core API's documentation to provide clearer, more complete information for developers ([Sendo-labs/sendo-api](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api)).

### Cross-Repository Coordination

**Establishing a Standardized Automation Framework**
*Goal: To create a central set of automated workflows that can be used by multiple projects to standardize release processes.*
- This week saw the launch of the new `Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows` repository, which provides a centralized source for development automation. This new shared infrastructure was immediately adopted by `Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore` to build out its automated release and publishing pipeline, demonstrating the immediate value of this cross-project initiative.

## Repository Spotlights

### Sendo-labs/frontend
The frontend application underwent a significant architectural overhaul to modernize its technology stack and prepare for future features.
- The project was successfully migrated from Vite+React to Next.js 15, and the development environment was updated to use modern tools like Bun and Biome ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/1)).
- The page structure was refactored to align with Next.js best practices, a key step toward enabling server-side data fetching from agents ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/3)).
- A new pull request was opened to begin implementing worker capabilities within the application ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/2)).

### Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows
This new repository was launched to provide a centralized, automated framework for managing releases and package publishing across the organization.
- The initial set of core workflows for versioning, releases, and npm publishing were created and merged, establishing the repository's foundational logic ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows/pull/1)).
- The new automation was successfully validated by executing the first automated release of the project, tagging v1.0.0 and updating the changelog ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows/pull/2), [#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows/pull/3)).

### Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore
Development focused on building a robust, automated release pipeline to ensure consistent and reliable deployments for the new plugin.
- A complete release and NPM publishing pipeline was implemented using GitHub Actions, automating the process from pull request merge to public release ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/2), [#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/5), [#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/6)).
- Preparations were made for the inaugural `1.0.0` release, leveraging the new automation pipeline ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/3)).
- The package was correctly configured with the `@sendo-labs` scope ([#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/7)) and an unused script was removed ([#8](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/8)).

### Sendo-labs/leaderboard
This repository saw a targeted maintenance update to keep its tracking data current.
- The tracker's configuration was updated to add new repositories, ensuring the leaderboard continues to provide a comprehensive overview of project activity ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/2)).

### Sendo-labs/sendo-api
Work this week focused on improving the project's accessibility for developers.
- A pull request was opened to enhance the `README.md` file, aiming to improve the quality and completeness of the project's primary documentation ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/2)).
