# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week was focused on strategic foundational improvements across the project. The most significant effort was a complete architectural overhaul of our frontend application, setting the stage for enhanced performance and future integration with AI agents. This modernization effort was complemented by key maintenance and documentation updates in other repositories to ensure the project's core systems remain robust and clear.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Modernizing the Frontend for Future AI Integration**
This initiative modernizes our technology stack to improve application performance and prepare for advanced features, such as fetching data directly from AI agents.
- The entire user interface was migrated to a more powerful and modern framework (Next.js 15), which included adopting new development tools to improve efficiency in [Sendo-labs/frontend](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend).
- The application's structure was reorganized to support future server-side data fetching, a key step toward deeper agent integration in [Sendo-labs/frontend](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend).

**Improving Project Health and Clarity**
We are ensuring our core systems and documentation remain robust, relevant, and accessible to our community and developers.
- The project leaderboard's tracking system was updated to include more repositories, ensuring its data remains comprehensive in [Sendo-labs/leaderboard](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard).
- Core documentation for our API was enhanced to provide clearer information for developers and contributors in [Sendo-labs/sendo-api](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api).

## Repository Spotlights

### Sendo-labs/frontend
The frontend saw a significant architectural overhaul aimed at modernizing the stack and preparing for future capabilities.

- The page structure was refactored to align with Next.js best practices, a preparatory step for fetching user data from agents on the server ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/3)).
- Initial work began on implementing new worker capabilities within the application ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/2)).

### Sendo-labs/leaderboard
Work focused on a targeted maintenance task to keep the leaderboard's data comprehensive.
- The tracker configuration was updated to add new repositories, expanding the scope of projects monitored by the leaderboard ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/2)).

### Sendo-labs/sendo-api
Activity was centered on improving the project's documentation for the community.
- The `README.md` file was updated to improve the quality and completeness of the project's primary documentation ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/2)).
