# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Oct 26 - 1, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week was marked by significant progress on two parallel fronts: strengthening our foundational infrastructure and delivering major enhancements to core product features. We automated key development and release processes across multiple repositories to increase velocity and reliability, while simultaneously shipping a new user authentication system, a revamped agent interface, and a powerful new wallet analysis plugin.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Strengthening Our Development and Release Infrastructure**
_Goal: To make our development lifecycle faster, more reliable, and more scalable, enabling our team to ship high-quality features with greater efficiency._
-   The release and deployment pipelines were automated for the **[Sendo-labs/plugin-solana](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-solana)**, **[Sendo-labs/plugin-jupiter](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-jupiter)**, and **[Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker)** repositories, streamlining how we publish updates.
-   A comprehensive suite of 98 automated tests was integrated into **[Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker)** to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
-   The core **[Sendo-labs/sendo-api](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api)** was made more stable and resilient by implementing a rate-limiting mechanism to manage service load.

**Enhancing Core Product and User Experience**
_Goal: To improve the usability, security, and power of our platform for every investor._
-   A new authentication system was integrated into the **[Sendo-labs/frontend](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend)**, providing users with robust and secure session management.
-   The agent interaction experience was completely overhauled in the **[Sendo-labs/frontend](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend)**, replacing the static panel with a dynamic and interactive chat interface.
-   The on-chain auction program in **[Sendo-labs/spotlight](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/spotlight)** was significantly hardened with secure fund transfer logic and new validation rules, increasing the security and reliability of auctions.

**Advancing Our Modular and Decentralized Architecture**
_Goal: To build a flexible, scalable platform that aligns with our core philosophies of modularity and open collaboration._
-   A new oracle bot was created in **[Sendo-labs/leaderboard-rewards](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard-rewards)** to automate the reward system for community contributors, a foundational step towards transparent and scalable compensation.
-   All wallet analysis functionality was migrated from the legacy `sendo-api` into the new **[Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser)**, creating a powerful, self-contained module and advancing our modular architecture.

### Cross-Repository Coordination
This week featured several initiatives that highlight the interconnected nature of our platform:
-   **Architectural Migration for Analysis:** In a significant move towards a more modular system, core functionality from **[Sendo-labs/sendo-api](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api)** was successfully migrated into the new **[Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser)**. This effort creates a more scalable and maintainable architecture for on-chain data analysis.
-   **Automated Contributor Rewards:** The new oracle bot in **[Sendo-labs/leaderboard-rewards](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard-rewards)** was built to integrate directly with the **[Sendo-labs/leaderboard](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard)** API. This connection automates the process of fetching contributor data and distributing rewards, linking community activity directly to compensation.

## Repository Spotlights

### Sendo-labs/frontend
The frontend saw major user-facing improvements, focusing on authentication and agent interaction.
-   Integrated the Privy authentication system to manage secure client-side and server-side user sessions ([#10](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/10)).
-   Replaced the `AgentPanel` with a new, more interactive `AgentChat` component, significantly upgrading the agent interaction UI ([#13](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/13)).
-   Streamlined the backend worker analysis workflow by automating data polling, which improved the user experience by removing a manual step ([#12](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/12)).
-   Conducted code refinement across multiple components to improve maintainability and readability ([#11](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/11), [#16](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/16)).

### Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser
This new plugin was rapidly developed into a core component by migrating and enhancing existing API functionality.
-   Migrated the entire `sendo-api` functionality into the plugin, establishing 7 new REST API endpoints for comprehensive wallet analysis ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/1)).
-   Enhanced the new API by adding cursor-based pagination to improve performance for large data sets on the `/trades`, `/signatures`, and `/transactions` endpoints ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/3)).
-   Updated the plugin to consume the latest Sendo API version and refreshed dependencies to ensure platform-wide compatibility ([#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/6), [#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/5)).

### Sendo-labs/leaderboard-rewards
Work was focused on building a new system to automate compensation for community contributors, aligning with our open-source philosophy.
-   Implemented the core logic for a new oracle bot that automates the entire reward lifecycle, from fetching contributor XP to distributing rewards ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard-rewards/pull/1)). This foundational work included comprehensive tests and supporting scripts for managing epochs and tokens.

### Sendo-labs/spotlight
Development centered on hardening the on-chain auction program to enhance its security and reliability.
-   Improved the security of fund transfers by implementing a Cross-Program Invocation (CPI) for deposits and direct lamport manipulation for payouts. This work also added critical validation rules to ensure auctions can only be settled by their creator and within the designated timeframe ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/spotlight/pull/1)).

### Sendo-labs/sendo-api
The API was refactored to improve modularity and stability, supporting the platform's growth.
-   Improved code maintainability by extracting trade-parsing logic into a dedicated utility, simplifying the main trades controller ([#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/7), [#9](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/9)).
-   Enhanced API stability by introducing a new rate-limiting mechanism and adding tests to ensure its effectiveness ([#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/6)).

### Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker
This repository received significant infrastructure upgrades to boost developer velocity and project stability.
-   Established a robust testing system with 98 automated tests to ensure code quality and prevent regressions ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/2)).
-   Implemented new GitHub Actions workflows to fully automate NPM publishing and release changelog generation ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/3), [#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/5)).
-   Refactored the plugin to use the official Eliza `getActionResults` API, improving maintainability and alignment with platform standards ([#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/4)).

### Sendo-labs/plugin-solana
This week's work established a modern, automated release process for the Solana plugin.
-   Overhauled the repository's CI/CD pipeline by replacing the legacy deployment workflow with new, automated processes for NPM publishing and release management ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-solana/pull/1)).

### Sendo-labs/plugin-jupiter
Foundational work was completed to create an efficient and reliable release process for the Jupiter plugin.
-   Implemented a new GitHub Actions workflow to automate NPM package publishing and the creation of GitHub releases, streamlining future deployments ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-jupiter/pull/2)).
