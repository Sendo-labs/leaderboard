# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Oct 26 - 1, 2025)

This week was marked by a dual focus on strengthening our development foundation and delivering significant new platform capabilities. We established robust automation for releasing code across multiple plugins while simultaneously launching a new automated contributor rewards system, overhauling the agent user experience, and expanding our core wallet analysis services.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Building a Foundation for Rapid, Reliable Development**
To accelerate our development cycle and ensure all new features are stable and easy to release, we invested heavily in our core infrastructure and automation.
-   Automated release and publishing pipelines were implemented for the [**plugin-solana**](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-solana/pull/1), [**plugin-jupiter**](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-jupiter/pull/2), and [**plugin-sendo-worker**](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/3) repositories, streamlining how we deliver updates.
-   A comprehensive testing framework with 98 automated tests was established in [**plugin-sendo-worker**](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/2) to improve code quality and prevent regressions.
-   The core [**sendo-api**](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/6) was made more stable by introducing rate limiting to prevent service overloads and ensure reliability.

**Expanding Core Analysis and Agent Capabilities**
To provide users with deeper on-chain insights and more powerful tools for their AI agents, we made significant progress on core feature development.
-   The new [**plugin-sendo-analyser**](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/1) was launched, integrating comprehensive wallet analysis features (trades, tokens, NFTs) directly into our plugin ecosystem.
-   The user-facing agent experience was completely overhauled in the [**frontend**](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/13), replacing the static panel with a new, interactive chat interface.
-   A new authentication system was integrated into the [**frontend**](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/10), providing secure session management for users.

**Automating Community Rewards and Decentralization**
To create a fair and transparent system for compensating contributors, reinforcing our commitment to open collaboration, we built a new automated system.
-   A new oracle bot was built in [**leaderboard-rewards**](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard-rewards/pull/1) to automatically fetch contributor data and manage reward distributions, ensuring scalability and verifiability.

**Hardening On-Chain Program Security**
To protect user assets and ensure the integrity of our on-chain auction mechanisms, we enhanced the security of our core smart contracts.
-   The [**spotlight**](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/spotlight/pull/1) on-chain auction program was significantly enhanced with secure SOL transfer logic and new validation rules to ensure auctions can only be settled by their creator within the designated timeframe.

### Cross-Repository Coordination

-   **API Migration and Integration**: Functionality from the `sendo-api` repository was successfully migrated into the new `plugin-sendo-analyser`, creating a more modular and scalable architecture for wallet analysis. This required coordinated updates to ensure the new plugin could consume the latest API changes ([sendo-api#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/6), [plugin-sendo-analyser#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/6)).
-   **Automated Rewards System**: The new oracle bot in `leaderboard-rewards` was designed to integrate directly with the `leaderboard` API, creating a seamless, automated system for calculating and distributing contributor rewards based on their XP.

## Repository Spotlights

### Sendo-labs/frontend
-   Integrated Privy to provide robust client-side and server-side user authentication and session management across the platform ([#10](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/10)).
-   Replaced the static `AgentPanel` with a new, interactive `AgentChat` component, significantly upgrading the agent interaction experience ([#13](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/13)).
-   Streamlined the backend worker analysis process by automating data polling and improving user waiting states, removing the need for a manual "suggest" button ([#12](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/12)).

### Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser
-   Completed a major migration of `sendo-api` functionality into the plugin, establishing 7 new REST API endpoints for comprehensive wallet analysis ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/1)).
-   Enhanced the new API by adding cursor-based pagination for trade, signature, and transaction history endpoints, improving performance for users with large histories ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/3)).
-   Updated the plugin to consume the latest Sendo API version and bumped the project version to 1.3.0 to reflect significant new features ([#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/6), [#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/7)).

### Sendo-labs/leaderboard-rewards
-   Implemented a new oracle bot to automate the entire contributor reward lifecycle, from fetching XP data from the leaderboard API to synchronizing reward distributions ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard-rewards/pull/1)).
-   Added comprehensive tests and supporting scripts to ensure the correctness and reliability of the new automated reward system.

### Sendo-labs/spotlight
-   Hardened the on-chain auction program by implementing secure SOL transfers using CPI and direct lamport manipulation, and adding critical validation rules for auction settlement ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/spotlight/pull/1
