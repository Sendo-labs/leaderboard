On Oct 25, 2025, the Sendo project saw significant infrastructure improvements across several repositories, with a strong focus on automating deployment and release processes through new GitHub workflows. Concurrently, the `sendo-api` repository addressed critical bug fixes related to pagination and refined buy/sell account logic, enhancing data accuracy and system stability. Additionally, initial steps were taken in `leaderboard-rewards` to implement a system for rewarding contributors.
