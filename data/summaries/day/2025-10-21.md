### Frontend Maintenance & Configuration
*   **Dependency Management**: Added missing dependencies to `bun.lock` and `package.json` in `Sendo-labs/frontend` to prevent potential build issues ([Sendo-labs/frontend#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/5)).
*   **Configuration File Handling**: Updated `.gitignore` to exclude local environment files and created an `.env.example` file in `Sendo-labs/frontend` for better configuration management ([Sendo-labs/frontend#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/4)).
