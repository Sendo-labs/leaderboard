On October 21, 2025, development focused on essential maintenance for the frontend, including dependency management to prevent build issues and refining `.gitignore` for better environment file handling. The `sendo-api` repository had no development activity.

## âœ… Completed Work
### Frontend Maintenance
*   Added missing dependencies to `bun.lock` and `package.json` to resolve potential build issues, ensuring project stability. ([Sendo-labs/frontend#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/5))
*   Updated `.gitignore` to specifically exclude local environment files while creating an `.env.example` for reference. ([Sendo-labs/frontend#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/4))
