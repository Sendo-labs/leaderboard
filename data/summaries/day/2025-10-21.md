On October 21, 2025, the ElizaOS project saw focused development on both API stability and frontend maintenance. A new pull request was opened in `sendo-api` to fix account-related issues, while the `sendo-frontend` team addressed dependency management and refined `.gitignore` rules to improve build reliability and environment file handling.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Frontend Maintenance & Configuration
*   Resolved potential build issues by adding missing dependencies to `bun.lock` and `package.json` in `Sendo-labs/frontend`. ([Sendo-labs/frontend#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/5))
*   Improved environment file management by updating `.gitignore` to exclude local environment files and creating an `.env.example` in `Sendo-labs/frontend`. ([Sendo-labs/frontend#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/4))
