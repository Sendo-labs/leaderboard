### Frontend Maintenance & Configuration
*   Added missing dependencies to the `frontend` project to prevent build issues and ensure stability ([Sendo-labs/frontend#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/5)).
*   Updated `.gitignore` and created an `.env.example` file in the `frontend` repository to improve local configuration management and provide a template for environment variables ([Sendo-labs/frontend#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/4)).
