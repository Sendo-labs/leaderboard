On Oct 21, 2025, the project saw focused development on both API stability and frontend maintenance. A new pull request was opened in `sendo-api` to fix an account-related issue, while the `frontend` repository addressed dependency management and refined `.gitignore` rules to prevent build problems and improve environment file handling.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Frontend Maintenance & Configuration
*   Added missing dependencies to `bun.lock` and `package.json` to resolve potential build issues in `Sendo-labs/frontend`. ([Sendo-labs/frontend#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/5))
*   Updated `.gitignore` to specifically exclude local environment files and created an `.env.example` file for configuration guidance in `Sendo-labs/frontend`. ([Sendo-labs/frontend#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/4))
