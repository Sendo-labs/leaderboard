Today, the project saw significant progress in both frontend clarity and backend interoperability. The `frontend` repository streamlined its UI by simplifying action status handling, while the `leaderboard` repository greatly enhanced its external integration capabilities with new JSON API endpoints and refined AI summary command logic.

## âœ… Completed Work
### UI/UX Refinements
*   The `ActionHistory` component in `Sendo-labs/frontend` was simplified by removing the 'accepted' status, improving UI clarity and maintainability. ([#8](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/8))

### API and Backend Enhancements
*   `Sendo-labs/leaderboard` introduced new static JSON API endpoints to expose leaderboard data, significantly improving interoperability for external applications. ([#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/4))
*   A bug fix in `Sendo-labs/leaderboard` made the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` conditional, ensuring it's only required for AI summary commands and preventing unnecessary dependencies. ([#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/5))
