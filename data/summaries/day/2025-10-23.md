Today, the Sendo project made significant strides in core functionality and external integration, with the frontend implementing a new worker system for enhanced agent processing and the leaderboard adding JSON API endpoints for improved data access. UI refinements and dependency updates also contributed to a more streamlined and up-to-date application.

## âœ… Completed Work
### Core System Enhancements
*   **Frontend Worker System**: A major worker implementation was added to the frontend, laying the groundwork for enhanced agent processing capabilities. ([Sendo-labs/frontend#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/2))
*   **Leaderboard API Enhancements**: New static JSON API endpoints were added to the leaderboard to expose data, facilitating programmatic access for external applications. ([Sendo-labs/leaderboard#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/4))

### UI and Dependency Refinements
*   **Frontend UI Refinements**: The `ActionHistory` component in the frontend was refactored to simplify action status handling by removing the 'accepted' status. ([Sendo-labs/frontend#8](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/8))
*   **Dependency Updates**: `@elizaos` dependencies were updated to version 1.6.3 in the frontend, ensuring the project uses the latest libraries. ([Sendo-labs/frontend#9](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/9))

### Bug Fixes
*   **AI Service Configuration Refinement**: A bug was fixed in the leaderboard to ensure `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is only required for AI summary commands, improving system flexibility. ([Sendo-labs/leaderboard#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/5))
