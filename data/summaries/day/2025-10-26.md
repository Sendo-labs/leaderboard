On Oct 26, 2025, the Sendo project significantly advanced its CI/CD capabilities across multiple plugin repositories by implementing automated NPM publishing and release workflows. Concurrently, the `spotlight` program saw major enhancements to SOL transfer and auction logic with comprehensive unit testing, while the `leaderboard-rewards` repository introduced an oracle bot for automated contributor reward distribution. The `plugin-sendo-analyser` also underwent a substantial migration of `sendo-api` functionality into the ElizaOS plugin, expanding its API endpoints with pagination.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### CI/CD and Release Automation
*   Automated NPM package publishing and release management workflows were implemented in `Sendo-labs/plugin-jupiter`, streamlining the deployment process. ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-jupiter/pull/2))
*   `Sendo-labs/plugin-solana` refactored its deployment and release workflows, replacing `npm-deploy` with new `publish-npm` and `release` workflows for enhanced automation. ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-solana/pull/1))
*   `Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker` established automated NPM publishing and release workflows, including configuration for release versions and changelog generation. ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/3), [#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/5))

### Core Program Logic and Testing Enhancements
*   `Sendo-labs/spotlight` enhanced SOL transfer and auction logic with proper CPI for user-to-vault transfers, direct lamport manipulation, admin verification, and time validation for auctions. ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/spotlight/pull/1))
*   Comprehensive unit tests were developed and integrated in `Sendo-labs/spotlight` to cover new SOL transfer logic and auction settlement mechanisms. ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/spotlight/pull/1))
*   `Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker` integrated a robust testing infrastructure with 98 automated tests, including real runtime testing, and refactored API usage to utilize the official Eliza `getActionResults` API. ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/2), [#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/4))

### New Feature Development and API Expansion
*   `Sendo-labs/leaderboard-rewards` implemented an oracle bot to automate contributor reward distribution by fetching XP data from the leaderboard API and synchronizing rewards. ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard-rewards/pull/1))
*   The `sendo-api` functionality was fully migrated into the ElizaOS plugin in `Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser`, introducing 7 new REST API endpoints and multi-protocol transaction support. ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/1))
*   `Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser` updated API endpoints for trades, signatures, and transactions to support cursor-based pagination. ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/3))
*   `Sendo-labs/frontend` integrated Privy authentication for client-side and server-side user authentication and session management. ([#10](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/10))

### Configuration and Documentation Updates
*   `Sendo-labs/leaderboard` added an analyser plugin to its pipeline configuration. ([#10](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/10))
*   `Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser` updated its `README.md` with comprehensive plugin details and fixed its `package.json` file. ([#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/4), [#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/2))
*   `Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker` applied minor fixes to update `bun.lock` and `package-lock.json` files and updated the `.gitignore`. ([#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/6), [#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/7))
