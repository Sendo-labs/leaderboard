On Oct 26, 2025, Sendo's development focused heavily on infrastructure, with multiple repositories implementing automated CI/CD pipelines for NPM publishing and release management. Significant progress was also made on core functionalities, including enhanced SOL transfer logic in `spotlight`, Privy authentication integration in `frontend`, and the migration of `sendo-api` into the `plugin-sendo-analyser` with pagination. A major new oracle bot was introduced in `leaderboard-rewards` to automate contributor reward distribution.
