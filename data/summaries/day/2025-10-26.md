On Oct 26, 2025, the Sendo project significantly advanced its automation and core functionalities, with multiple repositories implementing robust CI/CD pipelines for automated NPM publishing and release management. Key developments also included the integration of Privy authentication in the frontend, the migration and expansion of `sendo-api` functionality into the ElizaOS plugin with new API endpoints and pagination, and the introduction of an automated oracle bot for contributor reward distribution.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### CI/CD and Release Automation
*   Automated NPM publishing and release management workflows were implemented in `Sendo-labs/plugin-jupiter`, including configuration for release versions and changelog generation ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-jupiter/pull/2)).
*   The `Sendo-labs/plugin-solana` repository refactored its NPM deployment and release workflows, introducing new GitHub Actions for automated publishing and release management ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-solana/pull/1)).
*   `Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker` established automated NPM publishing and release workflows, including configuration files for release versions and changelog generation, and performed a release for version 1.0.0 ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/3), [#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/5)).

### Core Program Enhancements and API Development
*   The `sendo_spotlight` program in `Sendo-labs/spotlight` received significant updates to SOL transfer logic, admin verification for auction settlement, and time validation, along with comprehensive unit tests ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/spotlight/pull/1)).
*   `Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser` fully migrated `sendo-api` functionality into the ElizaOS plugin, introducing 7 new REST API endpoints with wallet analysis methods and multi-protocol transaction support ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/1)).
*   API endpoints for trades, signatures, and transactions in `Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser` now support cursor-based pagination, and the plugin's version was updated to 1.1.0 ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/3)).

### Infrastructure and Testing
*   A comprehensive testing infrastructure with 98 automated tests was integrated into `Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker` to ensure stability and prevent regressions ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/2)).
*   An oracle bot was implemented in `Sendo-labs/leaderboard-rewards` to automate contributor reward distribution by fetching XP data from the leaderboard API and syncing rewards ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard-rewards/pull/1)).
*   The `Sendo-labs/frontend` repository integrated Privy authentication for secure client-side and server-side user authentication and session management ([#10](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/10)).

### Minor Improvements and Documentation
*   `Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker` refactored API usage to utilize the official Eliza `getActionResults` API, added proper `HandlerOptions` typing in test helpers, and fixed parameter formats in fixtures ([#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/4)).
*   Minor fixes in `Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker` included updating dependencies and modifying the `.gitignore` file ([#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/6), [#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/7)).
*   Documentation for `Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser` was updated in the `README.md`, and a fix was implemented for the `package.json` file ([#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/4), [#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/2)).
*   `Sendo-labs/leaderboard` had a minor configuration update, adding an analyser plugin to the pipeline configuration ([#10](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/10)).
