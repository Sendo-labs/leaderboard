Oct 19, 2025 - Daily Project Summary

Today, the ElizaOS project saw significant foundational work across multiple repositories, including a major refactoring of the `frontend` to Next.js 15, the establishment of reusable CI/CD workflows, and the implementation of automated release and publishing processes for the `plugin-cryptoscore`. Additionally, the `sendo-api` documentation was translated to English, and the `leaderboard` expanded its tracking capabilities.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Frontend Modernization and Structure Improvements
*   The `frontend` project underwent a major refactoring, migrating from Vite+React to Next.js 15 with Bun, including configuration updates and the introduction of Biome for linting and formatting ([Sendo-labs/frontend#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/1)).
*   Page structures in `frontend` were improved to align with Next.js best practices, preparing for better data recovery and server-side data fetching ([Sendo-labs/frontend#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/3)).

### CI/CD and Release Automation
*   Initial reusable workflows for release management and npm package publishing were set up in `reusable-workflows`, including `release.yml`, `npm-publish.yml`, and `rws-versioning.yml` ([Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows/pull/1)).
*   Automated releases were performed for `reusable-workflows`, marking version 1.0.0 and updating `CHANGELOG.md` and `.release-please-manifest.json` ([Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows/pull/3), [Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows/pull/2)).
*   Automated release management and NPM publishing workflows were implemented in `plugin-cryptoscore`, including defining release versions and configuring changelog generation ([Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/2), [Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/6), [Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/5)).

### API Accessibility and Project Tracking
*   The `README.md` file for `sendo-api` was translated into English to enhance accessibility for a broader audience ([Sendo-labs/sendo-api#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/2)).
*   New repositories were added to the tracker configuration in `leaderboard`, expanding the scope of projects monitored ([Sendo-labs/leaderboard#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/2)).

### Plugin Configuration Adjustments
*   Bug fixes in `plugin-cryptoscore` included removing an unused publish script from `package.json` and updating the plugin's scope to `@sendo-labs` ([Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore#8](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/8), [Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/7)).
