Today, the project saw significant architectural shifts with the `frontend` migrating to Next.js 15 and adopting Bun, alongside the establishment of robust release and publishing workflows across `reusable-workflows` and `plugin-cryptoscore`. Maintenance efforts included updating the `sendo-api` README and expanding the `leaderboard`'s tracking configuration.
