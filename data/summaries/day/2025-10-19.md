Overall Project Summary for Oct 19, 2025:

Today was marked by significant foundational work across the project, including a major frontend migration to Next.js 15 with Bun, the establishment of robust reusable CI/CD workflows for releases and NPM publishing, and initial releases for both `reusable-workflows` and `plugin-cryptoscore`. Additionally, the `sendo-api` documentation was translated to English, and the `leaderboard` tracker configuration was updated.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### Frontend Modernization and Structure Improvements
*   The `frontend` project underwent a major refactoring, migrating from Vite+React to Next.js 15 with Bun, including configuration updates and the introduction of Biome for linting and formatting ([Sendo-labs/frontend#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/1)).
*   Page structures in `frontend` were improved to align with Next.js best practices, preparing the application for more robust data recovery and server-side data fetching ([Sendo-labs/frontend#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/3)).

### CI/CD and Release Management Setup
*   The `reusable-workflows` repository established foundational CI/CD infrastructure with reusable workflows for general project releases and npm package publishing ([Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows/pull/1)).
*   The `reusable-workflows` project completed its first release, version 1.0.0, incorporating new workflow and release management features ([Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows/pull/3), [Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows/pull/2)).
*   New GitHub Actions workflows were implemented in `plugin-cryptoscore` to automate release management and NPM package publishing, including versioning and changelog configuration ([Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/2)).
*   The NPM publishing trigger in `plugin-cryptoscore` was updated to activate on pull request merges, and reusable workflow references were updated ([Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/5), [Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/6)).

### API and Plugin Enhancements
*   The `README.md` file for `sendo-api` was updated with an English translation to enhance accessibility ([Sendo-labs/sendo-api#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/2)).
*   A chore was completed in `leaderboard` to update `config/pipeline.config.ts`, adding new repositories to the tracker for accurate monitoring ([Sendo-labs/leaderboard#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/2)).
*   Bug fixes were introduced in `plugin-cryptoscore` to refine the `package.json` file, removing an unused publish script and updating the plugin's scope to `@sendo-labs` ([Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/7), [Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore#8](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/8)).
