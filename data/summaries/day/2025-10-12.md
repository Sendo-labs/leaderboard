On October 12, 2025, the ElizaOS project saw significant foundational work on the frontend, with the initial project setup, integration of Eliza API dependencies, and the development of core UI components for agent and chat management. This crucial progress establishes the necessary infrastructure for future AI agent interactions and user interfaces.

### Frontend Infrastructure & Eliza Integration
- Initial project setup, including `.env.example` and `CLAUDE.md`, was established, and `package.json` was updated to include Eliza API dependencies. Core Eliza API client (`src/lib/elizaClient.js`) and base API client (`src/api/base44Client.js`) were introduced. ([Sendo-labs/frontend#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/2))
- New hooks (`useElizaAgent.js`, `useElizaChat.js`) were developed to manage Eliza agent and chat interactions. ([Sendo-labs/frontend#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/2))
- Essential UI components for agent interaction (`AgentSidebar.jsx`, `ChatInterface.jsx`) and general UI elements (`AnimatedMarkdown.jsx`, `Markdown.jsx`, `Tool.jsx`) were created, along with initial page layouts (`Agent.jsx`, `Layout.jsx`).
