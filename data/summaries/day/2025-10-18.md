On October 18, 2025, the Sendo project saw the foundational establishment of the `sendo-api` repository, including its core structure, transaction decoding utilities for various platforms, and initial API controllers and service integrations. This marks a significant step in building out the backend infrastructure for the Sendo platform. Other repositories, `reusable-workflows` and `frontend`, had no new developments.
