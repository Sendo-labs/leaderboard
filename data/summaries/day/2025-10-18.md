On October 18, 2025, the project saw significant foundational work with the `sendo-api` repository being initialized with core structure, API controllers, service integrations, and extensive transaction decoding utilities. Concurrently, the `reusable-workflows` repository began setting up its workflow and release management processes. The `frontend` repository had no new activity.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Project Initialization and Core Structure
- The `sendo-api` repository was initialized with a foundational commit, establishing the basic project structure, development environment configurations, and a README. ([Sendo-labs/sendo-api#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/1))
- Initial API controllers for global operations, NFTs, signatures, tokens, trades, and transactions were added to `sendo-api`, alongside integrations with external services like Birdeye and Helius. ([Sendo-labs/sendo-api#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/1))
- Extensive utilities for decoding various transaction types, including compute budget, Jupiter, Meteora, Orca, Pumpfun, Pumpswap, Raydium, and Whirlpool, were developed for `sendo-api`. ([Sendo-labs/sendo-api#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/1))
