On October 18, 2025, the ElizaOS project saw the significant initialization of the `Sendo-labs/sendo-api` repository, establishing its core structure, comprehensive transaction decoding utilities, and development environment setup. Other repositories like `Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows` and `Sendo-labs/frontend` reported no new activities.

### Project Initialization and Core API Structure
*   The `Sendo-labs/sendo-api` repository was initialized with a foundational commit, setting up essential configuration files, core controllers for various operations (global, NFTs, signatures, tokens, trades, transactions), and initial service integrations. ([Sendo-labs/sendo-api#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/1))
*   Extensive utilities for decoding various transaction types were developed, including decoders and schemas for compute budget, Jupiter, Meteora, Orca, Pumpfun, Pumpswap, Raydium, and Whirlpool protocols. ([Sendo-labs/sendo-api#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/1))
*   The initial commit also included the setup for the development environment, such as VS Code settings, and preliminary test files for Birdeye and transaction decoding. ([Sendo-labs/sendo-api#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/1))
