Today, the Sendo project made significant strides in core functionality and user experience. The `plugin-sendo-worker` saw its initial implementation of the Sendo Worker orchestrator, laying the groundwork for intelligent trading analysis, while the `sendo-api` addressed a critical bug in trading functionality. The `frontend` repository enhanced page consistency and introduced an onboarding flow, improving overall user interaction.
