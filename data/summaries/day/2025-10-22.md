The project also expanded its configuration pipeline by integrating new projects, enhancing modularity and adaptability.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Core Agent Functionality & Analysis
*   **Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker**: The core Sendo Worker orchestrator was fully implemented, enabling dynamic analysis, agent capability discovery, execution of analysis actions, and generation of LLM-powered recommendations ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/1)).

### API Stability & Trading Operations
*   **Sendo-labs/sendo-api**: A critical bug affecting buy and sell account operations was addressed and fixed, involving modifications across trade controllers, Birdeye services, and utility functions to ensure stable and correct trading processes ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/3)).

### Frontend UI/UX & Readability
*   **Sendo-labs/frontend**: A new `PageWrapper` component was introduced to standardize layouts and styling across main pages, including `analyzer`, `leaderboard`, `worker`, and `onboarding`, ensuring a consistent user experience ([#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/7)).
*   **Sendo-labs/frontend**: The `worker-plugin` was refactored to improve code clarity and maintainability, specifically by updating label elements in the `RuleBuilder` component for better readability ([#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/6)).

### Platform Expansion & Modularity
*   **Sendo-labs/leaderboard**: New projects were added to the configuration pipeline, expanding the system's capabilities and data sources, which directly contributes to the framework's modularity and adaptability ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/3)).

## üèóÔ∏è Work in Progress
### New Pull Requests
*   **Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker**: A new pull request has been opened to add a comprehensive test infrastructure, including real runtime testing, for the Sendo Worker ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/2)).
