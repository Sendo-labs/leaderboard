On October 29, 2025, Sendo's development focused on core API refinements, plugin compatibility, and frontend enhancements. The `sendo-api` saw significant refactoring of trade controller logic, while the `plugin-sendo-analyser` was updated to integrate with the latest API and bumped its version to 1.3.0. Concurrently, the `frontend` repository introduced a new worker creation feature and standardized code formatting for improved consistency.

## âœ… Completed Work

### API & Plugin Integration
*   The `plugin-sendo-analyser` was updated to utilize the latest Sendo API, impacting core services and utilities, and its version was bumped to 1.3.0. ([Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/6), [Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/7))

### API Refinements & Modularity
*   The `sendo-api`'s trade controller logic was cleaned up by extracting the `parseTrade` function into a new, dedicated utility file for better modularity and maintainability. ([Sendo-labs/sendo-api#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/7), [Sendo-labs/sendo-api#9](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/9))
*   Initial refactoring work was done on API calls within `sendo-api`, including temporary adjustments to `parseTrade.ts` and `helius.ts`. ([Sendo-labs/sendo-api#8](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/8))

### Frontend Feature & Code Standardization
*   A new feature for worker creation was introduced in the `frontend`, alongside significant code formatting standardization across several core files to improve readability and consistency. ([Sendo-labs/frontend#16](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/16))
