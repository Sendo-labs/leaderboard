On Oct 29, 2025, significant progress was made on API integration and code refactoring across the Sendo project. The `plugin-sendo-analyser` was updated to integrate the latest Sendo API and bumped to version 1.3.0, while the `sendo-api` repository saw substantial cleanup and reorganization of trade-related logic. The `frontend` repository focused on improving code readability and consistency, particularly in agent and chat creation functions.
