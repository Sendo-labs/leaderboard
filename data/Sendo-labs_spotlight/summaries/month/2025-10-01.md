# Sendo-labs/spotlight Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October was a month of foundational development for the `sendo_spotlight` program. Efforts were concentrated on implementing and robustifying core on-chain logic for Solana-based auctions. The primary achievement was the successful completion of a major pull request that introduced critical SOL transfer mechanisms, enhanced security through admin verification, and ensured operational correctness with time validation. This work was supported by the creation of comprehensive unit tests, establishing a solid base for future development.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Development this month centered on a single, significant enhancement to the core on-chain program.

- **Enhanced Auction and SOL Transfer Logic:** A major update was completed to robustify the auction settlement process. This included implementing precise SOL transfer mechanisms, distinguishing between user-to-vault CPI and direct lamport transfers for vault-to-recipient transactions. To improve security and control, admin verification was added to ensure only the auction creator can settle it. The logic was further strengthened with time validation to enforce that auction operations occur within their defined periods. These new features were validated through a suite of comprehensive unit tests ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/spotlight/pull/1)).
