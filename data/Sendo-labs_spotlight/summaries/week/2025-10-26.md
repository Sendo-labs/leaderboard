# Sendo-labs/spotlight Weekly Report (Oct 26 - 1, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's development focused on establishing a robust and secure foundation for the `sendo_spotlight` on-chain program. Significant progress was made on the core auction mechanism, with the implementation of secure SOL transfer logic using both CPI and direct lamport manipulation. To enhance security and control, new validation rules were introduced, restricting auction settlement to the creator and enforcing designated timeframes. This foundational work was supported by the creation of comprehensive unit tests to ensure the reliability of these critical components.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
All development this period was consolidated into a single, focused effort to enhance the core auction program's security and reliability.

- **Auction Program Hardening**
  A comprehensive pull request ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/spotlight/pull/1)) introduced several key features and improvements to the on-chain program. The SOL transfer logic was significantly enhanced, implementing a proper Cross-Program Invocation (CPI) for user-to-vault transfers and using direct lamport manipulation for vault-to-recipient transfers. New validation rules were added to the auction settlement process, including admin verification to restrict settlement to the auction creator and time validation to ensure settlements occur only within the designated window. To guarantee the stability of these new features, extensive unit tests were developed and integrated.
