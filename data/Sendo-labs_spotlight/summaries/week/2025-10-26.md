# Sendo-labs/spotlight Weekly Report (Oct 26 - 1, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's development was concentrated on fortifying the `sendo_spotlight` on-chain program. Significant progress was made in enhancing the security and reliability of the auction settlement process by introducing admin-only verification and strict time validation. The underlying SOL transfer logic was also refined for greater precision. These foundational improvements were rigorously validated through the implementation of a comprehensive unit test suite, ensuring the stability of the core program.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this period focused on a single, impactful pull request aimed at increasing the robustness of the on-chain auction mechanics.

- **Auction Security and Logic Enhancements**
  - Development efforts culminated in PR [#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/spotlight/pull/1), which introduced several critical updates to the auction program. To improve security, admin verification was added to ensure only the auction creator can settle an auction. Time validation was also implemented to enforce that auction operations occur only within their defined periods. Furthermore, the SOL transfer logic was updated to use more precise mechanisms, distinguishing between CPIs and direct lamport transfers. These changes were accompanied by a full suite of unit tests to validate the new functionality.
