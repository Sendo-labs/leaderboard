      "summary": "Neysixx: This month, Neysixx led a foundational overhaul of the `Sendo-labs/frontend` repository, merging six pull requests focused on restructuring and feature development. Their most impactful contribution was a massive project-wide refactor to update the structure and configurations (Sendo-labs/frontend#1), which involved over 34,000 line changes. In addition, they implemented new pages (Sendo-labs/frontend#7), improved the page structure (Sendo-labs/frontend#3), and resolved a critical build issue by adding missing dependencies (Sendo-labs/frontend#5). This work demonstrates a clear focus on large-scale refactoring and feature implementation within the frontend codebase."
