# Sendo-labs/plugin-solana Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October's development was focused on foundational infrastructure, specifically overhauling the project's deployment and release automation. The primary effort involved refactoring the existing deployment workflow into a more modular and robust system. This change enhances control over package publishing and release management, establishing a streamlined process for future updates and aligning with the core philosophy of modularity and scalability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on improving the repository's automation and release infrastructure.

- **Deployment and Release Workflow Refactor:**
  A significant refactoring effort replaced the monolithic `npm-deploy` workflow with two distinct, specialized workflows: `publish-npm` for package publishing and `release` for managing GitHub releases. This separation provides greater control and clarity in the deployment pipeline. To support this new automated process, configuration files for `release-please` (`.release-please-manifest.json` and `release-please-config.json`) were introduced to manage versioning and changelog generation automatically. This entire initiative was completed in pull request [#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-solana/pull/1).
