# Sendo-labs/plugin-solana Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October's development activity was focused on establishing a robust foundation for the project's future growth. The primary effort this month involved a significant overhaul of the repository's CI/CD infrastructure. By implementing an automated release and NPM publishing pipeline, the project has enhanced its modularity and adaptability. This foundational work streamlines the development lifecycle, ensuring that future contributions can be versioned, documented, and distributed more efficiently.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on improving the project's automation and release management processes.

- **Enhanced Release and Publishing Automation**
  A major refactoring of the repository's release infrastructure was completed to automate NPM publishing and release management. This involved replacing a previous workflow with a new system leveraging `release-please` for streamlined versioning and changelog generation. The introduction of `release-please-manifest.json`, `release-please-config.json`, and new GitHub Actions workflows improves the scalability of the CI/CD pipeline, aligning with Sendo's core philosophy of modularity ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-solana/pull/1)).
