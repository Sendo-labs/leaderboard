# Sendo-labs/plugin-solana Daily Update (Oct 26, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on refining the repository's automation infrastructure, specifically by overhauling the NPM deployment and release management workflows. This involved replacing an existing workflow and introducing new configurations for automated publishing and release processes.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Automated Release and Publishing Workflows
The repository's automation for publishing to NPM and managing releases has been significantly refactored. This includes the introduction of `release-please-manifest.json` and `release-please-config.json` to streamline versioning and changelog generation, alongside new GitHub Actions workflows for automated NPM publishing and release management. This change improves the modularity and adaptability of the CI/CD pipeline, aligning with Sendo's core philosophy. ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-solana/pull/1))
