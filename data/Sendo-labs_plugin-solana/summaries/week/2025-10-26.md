# Sendo-labs/plugin-solana Weekly Report (Oct 26 - 1, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's efforts were dedicated to establishing a robust foundation for the project's development lifecycle. The primary focus was on overhauling the repository's automation infrastructure by refactoring the deployment and release workflows. This foundational work introduces a more streamlined and automated process for package publishing and release management, setting the stage for efficient and reliable future development.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
### Enhanced Repository Automation and Release Process
- The project's release and deployment pipeline was significantly improved to enhance automation and control. The legacy `npm-deploy` workflow was replaced by two new, more specific workflows: `publish-npm` for automated publishing to the NPM registry and `release` for comprehensive release management. To support this, configuration for `release-please` was introduced to manage release versioning and automate changelog generation, as detailed in PR [#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-solana/pull/1).
