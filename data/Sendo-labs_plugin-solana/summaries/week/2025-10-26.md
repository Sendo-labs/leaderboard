# Sendo-labs/plugin-solana Weekly Report (Oct 26 - 1, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's development was concentrated on foundational infrastructure, specifically overhauling the project's release and deployment automation. A significant refactor of the CI/CD pipeline was completed to streamline the process of publishing to NPM and managing releases. This effort enhances the modularity and adaptability of our development workflows, directly aligning with Sendo's core philosophies of automation and scalability.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week focused on improving the repository's internal processes rather than adding new features.

- **Enhanced Automated Release and Publishing Workflows**
  A major refactoring of the repository's automation was completed to improve how new versions are published and released. The previous system was replaced with new GitHub Actions workflows that leverage `release-please` for automated versioning and changelog generation. This change, introduced in PR [#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-solana/pull/1), makes the release process more robust and less dependent on manual intervention.
