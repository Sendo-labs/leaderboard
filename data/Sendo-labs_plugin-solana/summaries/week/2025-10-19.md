# Sendo-labs/plugin-solana Weekly Report (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's development activity focused on establishing a robust and modular deployment pipeline for the project. The primary effort involved initiating a refactor of the continuous integration and deployment workflow. A new pull request was opened to replace the existing deployment process, signaling a move towards greater clarity and separation of concerns in how the plugin is published and released. This foundational work aligns with the core philosophy of modularity and sets the stage for a more scalable development process.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
### Deployment Workflow Refinement
The main technical effort this week was centered on improving the project's deployment process.
- A new pull request, [#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-solana/pull/1), was opened to refactor the CI/CD pipeline. This change proposes replacing the single `npm-deploy` workflow with two distinct workflows: `publish-npm` for package publication and `release` for creating GitHub releases. This separation aims to improve the modularity and maintainability of the deployment process.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed this week.
- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened, and there are no active issues reported from the period.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Development activity this week was concentrated on the single, foundational pull request concerning the deployment workflow. The focus on this core infrastructure piece suggests a deliberate effort to establish solid project foundations early on.
