# Sendo-labs/sendo-api Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October marked the inception of the `sendo-api` project. The month's activity was defined by a single, comprehensive commit that established the entire foundational architecture of the service. This initial push included core API controllers, integrations with key external services, and a sophisticated suite of transaction decoding utilities for various protocols. The groundwork laid this month paves the way for all future development on the Sendo API.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Development this month was focused exclusively on establishing the project's core infrastructure and initial feature set.

- **Project Initialization and Foundational Architecture:** The repository was brought to life with a foundational commit that set up the entire project structure ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/1)). This included:
    - **Core API Controllers:** Initial controllers for handling global operations, NFTs, signatures, tokens, trades, and transactions were created.
    - **Service Integrations:** The groundwork was laid for integrating with external services, specifically Birdeye and Helius.
    - **Transaction Decoding Utilities:** A significant effort was dedicated to building a robust system for decoding a wide array of transaction types. This includes schemas and decoders for protocols such as Jupiter, Meteora, Orca, Pumpfun, Pumpswap, Raydium, and Whirlpool.

- **Documentation:** Following the initial setup, work began on improving the project's documentation with an update to the `README.md` file ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/2)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.
- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were reported, and there were no active issues with significant discussion. The project's issue tracker remained quiet as development focused on the initial setup.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
As the project was just initiated this month, community interaction was minimal. The development activity was characterized by focused, foundational work, with no significant discussions or collaborative reviews noted in the pull requests.
