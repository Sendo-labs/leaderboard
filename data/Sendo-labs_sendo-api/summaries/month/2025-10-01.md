# Sendo-labs/sendo-api Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October marked the inception of the `sendo-api` project, with development kicking off with a massive foundational commit. This initial work established the entire project structure, including core API controllers, service integrations, and a comprehensive suite of transaction decoding utilities for various blockchain protocols. Following the initial setup, efforts quickly shifted to stabilization, with a critical bug fix for trading functionality and improvements to project documentation to enhance accessibility for a broader audience. The month was characterized by rapid foundational development and immediate refinement.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month focused on establishing the core architecture and ensuring its initial stability.

-   **Project Initialization and Core Services**
    The project was officially launched with an initial commit that laid the complete groundwork for the Sendo API. This included setting up the application's core structure and establishing API controllers for key functionalities such as NFTs, signatures, tokens, trades, and transactions. Integrations with essential third-party services like Birdeyes and Helius were also configured from the outset ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/1)).

-   **Advanced Transaction Decoding**
    A significant part of the initial development was dedicated to building a robust set of utilities for decoding a wide array of transaction types. Support was implemented for protocols including Jupiter, Meteora, Orca, Pumpfun, Pumpswap, Raydium, and Whirlpool, providing a crucial capability for processing and understanding on-chain interactions ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/1)).

-   **Bug Fixes and Stabilization**
    Shortly after the initial build, a critical bug affecting buy and sell account operations was identified and resolved. The fix required modifications across the trade controller, Birdeye service, and transaction decoding utilities, demonstrating a focus on hardening the new trading functionality ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/3)).

-   **Documentation**
    To improve project accessibility, the `README.md` file was translated into English, making the project's goals and setup instructions available to a wider, global audience ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/2)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
-   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed in October.
-   **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened or saw significant discussion during this period. Development appears to be tracked directly through pull requests at this early stage.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
As the project is in its nascent stage, development activity was concentrated and focused. The work completed this month reflects a core development effort to build the foundation, with no significant external community discussion or contributions noted in the reports. All progress was managed through a small number of targeted pull requests.
