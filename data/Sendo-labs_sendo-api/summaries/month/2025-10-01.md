# Sendo-labs/sendo-api Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October marked the inception of the `sendo-api` repository, laying the critical groundwork for the project. The month began with a massive initial commit that established the entire project architecture, including controllers, services, and a comprehensive suite of utilities for decoding on-chain transactions. Following this foundational work, development shifted towards stabilization and refinement. Key efforts included fixing critical bugs related to buy/sell account logic and data pagination, enhancing data analysis capabilities with rate limiting, and refactoring core trade-parsing logic to improve code maintainability for future growth.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Development this month progressed from initial setup to stabilization and code quality improvements, establishing a solid base for the API.

*   **Project Initialization and Core Architecture**
    *   The repository was brought to life with its first commit, which established the complete directory structure, configuration files, and initial controllers for NFTs, tokens, and trades. A significant part of this initial work was the creation of utility functions to decode transactions from a wide range of protocols, including Jupiter, Meteora, Orca, Pumpfun, and Raydium, which is central to the project's mission of analyzing on-chain history ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/1)).

*   **Bug Fixes and Stability**
    *   Several critical bugs were addressed to improve the API's reliability. A significant fix resolved issues in buy/sell account operations, requiring updates across trade controllers, services, and utility functions ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/3), [#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/4)).
    *   A pagination error affecting data retrieval was corrected by modifying the `trades.ts` controller and `helius.ts` service, ensuring data is loaded correctly ([#5](https://github.comcom/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/5)).

*   **Refactoring and Enhancements**
    *   To improve code organization, the `parseTrade` function was extracted from the main trades controller and moved into its own dedicated utility file, `src/utils/parseTrade.ts` ([#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/7), [#9](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/9)). This cleanup makes the trade logic more modular and maintainable.
    *   Data analysis capabilities were enhanced, and a rate-limiting mechanism was implemented to manage API calls effectively. This effort included adding new tests to validate the functionality ([#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/6)).
    *   API call and temporary file handling logic were also refactored for better efficiency ([#8](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/8)).

*   **Documentation**
    *   The project's `README.md` was updated with an English translation to improve accessibility for a broader, international audience of contributors and users ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/2)).
