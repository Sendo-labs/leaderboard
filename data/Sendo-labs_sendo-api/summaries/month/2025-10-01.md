# Sendo-labs/sendo-api Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October marked the inception of the Sendo-labs/sendo-api repository, laying a comprehensive foundation for the project. The initial commit established the core application structure, complete with API controllers, service integrations, and extensive transaction decoding utilities for various blockchain protocols. Following this foundational work, development quickly shifted to stabilization and accessibility, with a critical bug fix for trading functionality and an English translation of the project's README to welcome a broader audience. This initial burst of activity has successfully set the stage for building out the modular, open-source AI agent framework envisioned by ElizaOS.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
This month's work was centered on establishing the project's core and ensuring its initial stability.

- **Project Initialization and Foundational Architecture**
  The project was officially launched with a massive initial commit that established the entire boilerplate and core logic. This included setting up API controllers for key functionalities like NFTs, trades, tokens, and transactions. Crucially, it also integrated initial services for Birdeye and Helius and implemented a suite of transaction decoding utilities for protocols such as Jupiter, Meteora, Orca, Pumpfun, and Raydium, providing a solid base for processing blockchain interactions ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/1)).

- **Critical Bug Fixes**
  Early development addressed a significant bug impacting buy and sell account operations. The fix required modifications across the trade controller, Birdeye service, and utility functions for balance extraction and rate limiting, ensuring the reliability of core trading functionality right from the start ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/3)).

- **Documentation and Accessibility**
  To support a wider community, the `README.md` file was translated into English. This effort makes the project's goals and setup instructions more accessible to a global audience of potential contributors and users ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/2)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The project is in its nascent stages, and issue tracking has not yet become a major activity.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed in October.
- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were reported this month. There are no active issues with significant discussion, indicating that development is currently focused on the initial build-out rather than addressing community-reported bugs or feature requests.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
As the project was just initiated this month, development activity was concentrated and foundational. The work was completed through a series of sequential pull requests, suggesting a focused effort by the initial development team. There were no instances of broad community discussion on pull requests or issues, which is typical for a project in its first days of existence. The primary focus was on establishing a stable codebase to build upon.
