# Sendo-labs/sendo-api Daily Update (Oct 29, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on refactoring and cleaning up trade-related logic within the API, specifically by moving `parseTrade` functionality into dedicated utility files for better organization.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Trade Logic Refactoring and Cleanup
*   The `parseTrade` function was moved from `src/controllers/trades.ts` to a new utility file, `src/utils/parseTrade.ts`, to improve code organization and maintainability ([#9](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/9), [#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/7)).
*   The `trades` controller was cleaned up as part of the `parseTrade` extraction ([#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/7)).

### API Call and Temporary File Management
*   Refactoring work was done on API calls and temporary file handling, involving `src/parseTrade.ts` and `src/services/helius.ts` ([#8](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/8)).
