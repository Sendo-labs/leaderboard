# Sendo-labs/sendo-api Daily Update (Oct 29, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on refactoring and cleaning up trade-related logic within the `sendo-api` repository, primarily by extracting `parseTrade` functionality into dedicated utility files.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Trade Logic Refactoring and Utility Extraction
*   The `parseTrade` function was moved from `src/controllers/trades.ts` to a new utility file, `src/utils/parseTrade.ts`, to improve code organization and maintainability. ([#9](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/9), [#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/7))
*   The `trades` controller was cleaned up following the extraction of the `parseTrade` logic. ([#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/7))

### API Call and Temporary File Management
