# Sendo-labs/sendo-api Daily Update (Oct 28, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on enhancing data analysis and implementing rate limiting mechanisms. This included modifications to services, controllers, and utilities, alongside the addition of new tests to ensure functionality.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Data Analysis and Rate Limiting Improvements
Significant work was done to ameliorate data analysis and integrate rate limiting. This involved updates to `src/controllers/trades.ts`, `src/services/birdeyes.ts`, `src/services/helius.ts`, and `src/utils/rateLimiter.ts`. New tests, `tests/loadMoreTest.ts` and `tests/rateLimitTest.ts`, were also added to validate these changes. ([#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/6))
