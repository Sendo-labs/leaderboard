## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Data Analysis and Rate Limiting Enhancements
Improvements were made to data analysis capabilities and rate limiting. This involved changes across several files, including `src/controllers/trades.ts`, `src/services/birdeyes.ts`, `src/services/helius.ts`, and `src/utils/rateLimiter.ts`. New test files, `tests/loadMoreTest.ts` and `tests/rateLimitTest.ts`, were also introduced to support these changes. ([#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/6))
