# Sendo-labs/sendo-api Weekly Report (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's development focused on enhancing the project's stability and accessibility. Efforts began with a significant documentation update, providing an English translation of the `README.md` to better serve a global audience. The main technical achievement was the resolution of a critical bug within the trading functionality, ensuring the reliability of buy/sell account operations. Overall, it was a week of targeted improvements and stabilization rather than new feature development.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week was concentrated in two key areas: documentation and critical bug fixes.

### Documentation and Accessibility
*   To improve clarity and accessibility for international contributors and users, the project's `README.md` was updated with a full English translation ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/2)).

### Trading Functionality Bug Fix

This comprehensive fix required changes across multiple core components, including `src/controllers/trades.ts`, the Birdeye service (`src/services/birdeyes.ts`), and utility functions for balance extraction and rate limiting, ultimately strengthening the reliability of the trading system ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/3)).
