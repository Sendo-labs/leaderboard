# Sendo-labs/sendo-api Weekly Report (Oct 26 - 1, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's development focused on enhancing the API's robustness and maintainability. Key efforts included the implementation of a rate-limiting mechanism to ensure service stability and significant refactoring of the trade data processing logic. By improving code organization and introducing new validation tests, the team has strengthened the backend infrastructure, paving the way for more scalable and reliable data analysis features.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week centered on foundational improvements to the API's performance and code structure.

- **API Stability and Rate Limiting**
  To manage API load and ensure consistent performance, a rate-limiting mechanism was introduced. This effort involved modifications to the `birdeyes` and `helius` services, the `trades` controller, and the creation of a new `rateLimiter` utility. The implementation was validated with new load and rate limit tests to confirm its effectiveness ([#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/6)).

- **Trade Logic Refactoring**
  A significant cleanup of trade-related code was undertaken to improve modularity and maintainability. The `parseTrade` function was extracted from the main `trades` controller and moved into its own dedicated utility file, `src/utils/parseTrade.ts`. This refactoring simplifies the controller and centralizes parsing logic for easier updates in the future ([#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/7), [#8](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/8), [#9](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/9)).
