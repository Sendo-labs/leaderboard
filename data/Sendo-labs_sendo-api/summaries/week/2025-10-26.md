# Sendo-labs/sendo-api Weekly Report (Oct 26 - 1, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's development focused on strengthening the API's foundation through significant code refactoring and service enhancements. Key efforts involved improving code modularity by extracting trade-parsing logic into a dedicated utility, which simplifies the `trades` controller. Additionally, core data services were improved with the implementation of rate limiting to ensure API stability and reliability. These foundational improvements align with the project's philosophy of building a robust and scalable platform.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on refactoring and enhancing core API functionalities.

- **Trade Logic Refactoring**
  To improve code organization and maintainability, the `parseTrade` function was extracted from `src/controllers/trades.ts` into a new, dedicated utility file, `src/utils/parseTrade.ts`. This cleanup simplifies the trades controller and centralizes parsing logic ([#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/7), [#9](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/9)). Further refactoring was also applied to API calls and temporary file management related to this function ([#8](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/8)).

- **Data Service and Rate Limiting Enhancements**
  Core services for data retrieval, including `birdeyes.ts` and `helius.ts`, were updated to enhance data analysis capabilities. A new rate-limiting mechanism was introduced via `src/utils/rateLimiter.ts` to manage API usage. To ensure the stability of these changes, new tests for load-more functionality and rate limiting were added ([#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/6)).
