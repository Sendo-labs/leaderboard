## üöÄ Highlights
This week marked the inception of the Sendo API project. The repository was initialized with a comprehensive first commit that established the foundational architecture for the entire service. This initial push laid the groundwork by setting up the core application structure, creating essential API controllers, and integrating key transaction decoding utilities for various blockchain protocols. The project begins with a clear structure and defined initial capabilities, ready for future development.
