# Sendo-labs/sendo-api Weekly Report (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week marked the official inception of the `sendo-api` repository. All development was concentrated on a single, comprehensive foundational commit that established the project's entire initial structure. This work laid the groundwork for the ElizaOS mission by creating the core API controllers, integrating with essential external services like Birdeye and Helius, and notably, implementing an extensive suite of transaction decoding utilities for various Web3 protocols. The project begins with a robust architectural base, ready for future development.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
All of this week's progress stems from the initial project setup, which introduced the foundational codebase.

- **Project Initialization and Core Architecture:** The repository was brought to life with a foundational commit that established the complete initial project structure. This single effort ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/1)) included the setup of development environment configurations, API controllers for global operations, NFTs, signatures, tokens, and transactions. A significant portion of this initial work was dedicated to building a comprehensive set of utilities for decoding a wide array of transaction types, including those from Jupiter, Meteora, Orca, Pumpfun, Raydium, and Whirlpool.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
As the project was initialized this week, the issue tracker remains clean.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed this week.
- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened, and there are no active issues at this time.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week's activity was focused entirely on the foundational commit to establish the repository. As the project has just been created, community interaction and collaborative development have not yet commenced. The focus was on laying the initial technical groundwork for future contributions.
