# Sendo-labs/sendo-api Weekly Report (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week marked the inception of the Sendo API project. All activity centered on the initial commit, which established the foundational architecture of the repository. This foundational work included setting up the core application structure, integrating essential third-party services like Birdeye and Helius, and implementing a comprehensive suite of transaction decoding utilities. The project now has a solid base, with initial controllers and services in place for future development.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
All development this week was consolidated into the project's first pull request, which laid the complete groundwork for the API.

- **Project Initialization and Core Services**
  - The repository was officially initialized with its core structure, including application logic, configuration files, and initial service integrations. A key part of this setup was the establishment of API controllers for global data, NFTs, signatures, tokens, trades, and transactions. The initial integration with Birdeye and Helius services was also completed, providing a foundation for external data fetching ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/1)).

- **Transaction Decoding Utilities**
  - A significant feature introduced in the initial commit is a robust set of utilities for decoding various blockchain transaction types. Support was added for a wide range of protocols, including Jupiter, Meteora, Orca, Pumpfun, Pumpswap, Raydium, and Whirlpool, which is critical for processing and interpreting on-chain interactions ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/1)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
As the project was just initiated this week, there was no activity related to issues.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed.
- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened, and there are no active issues at this time.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
