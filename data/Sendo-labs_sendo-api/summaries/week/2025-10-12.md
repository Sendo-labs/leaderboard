# Sendo-labs/sendo-api Weekly Report (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week marked the inception of the `sendo-api` project. The repository was initialized with a single, comprehensive commit that established the entire foundational architecture. This initial setup included not only the core application structure with controllers and services but also a crucial suite of utilities for decoding on-chain transactions. This foundational work paves the way for the project's core mission of enabling users to analyze their on-chain history.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Activity this week was focused exclusively on establishing the project's initial codebase.

### Project Initialization and Foundational Architecture
The project was brought to life with a massive initial commit that laid the groundwork for all future development. This foundational effort established the core structure and essential functionalities required for the API. Key components introduced in this commit include:
- **Core Application Structure:** Initial controllers for NFTs, tokens, and trades were created, alongside corresponding services and configuration files.
- **Transaction Decoding Utilities:** A significant set of utility functions was developed to decode a wide variety of on-chain transactions. This provides critical support for analyzing activity from major protocols such as Jupiter, Meteora, Orca, Pumpfun, Pumpswap, Raydium, and Whirlpool.
