# Sendo-labs/plugin-jupiter Weekly Report (Oct 26 - 1, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's development was dedicated to establishing a robust foundation for the project's lifecycle management. The primary focus was on building out the CI/CD infrastructure to ensure efficient and reliable future deployments. Key efforts centered on implementing automated workflows using GitHub Actions for NPM publishing and release management. This foundational work streamlines the development process, allowing for more rapid and consistent updates as the project evolves.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
All development this week focused on creating a modern, automated deployment pipeline.

### CI/CD and Release Automation
- Foundational CI/CD workflows were established to automate the release cycle. A new GitHub Actions pipeline now handles the NPM publishing process and manages versioning and releases, as detailed in PR [#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-jupiter/pull/2).
- To support this automation, `release-please-manifest.json` was configured to define the project's versioning strategy, and `release-please-config.json` was added to control release types and the automatic generation of changelogs.
