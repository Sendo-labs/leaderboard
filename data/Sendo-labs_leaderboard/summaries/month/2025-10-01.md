# Sendo-labs/leaderboard Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October marked the inception of the Sendo-labs/leaderboard project. Development focused on establishing the foundational infrastructure for tracking contributions across our ecosystem. The initial contributor tracking system was successfully implemented, laying the essential groundwork for future analytics. This system was later expanded to include additional repositories, ensuring the leaderboard will have a comprehensive view of project activity from the outset.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on creating and configuring the core tracking mechanism for the leaderboard.

- **Contributor Tracking System Initialization:** The project kicked off with the initialization of the contributor tracking system. This foundational step establishes the core analytics pipeline necessary for the leaderboard's function ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/1)).
- **Configuration Updates:** The scope of the tracker was expanded through a configuration update. This chore involved adding new repositories to `config/pipeline.config.ts`, ensuring a broader range of project contributions are captured ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/2)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed in October.
- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were reported, and there were no active issues with significant discussion during this period. The project's focus remained on initial setup rather than bug fixing or feature requests.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
As the project is in its earliest phase, collaboration was focused and direct. The development activity consisted of two foundational pull requests. The provided reports do not indicate broader community discussion or multiple contributors at this stage, which is typical for a repository in its initial setup phase.
