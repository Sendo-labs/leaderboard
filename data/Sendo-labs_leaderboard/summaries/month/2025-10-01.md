# Sendo-labs/leaderboard Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October marked the foundational month for the Sendo-labs/leaderboard project, beginning with the initialization of the core contributor tracking system. Development quickly accelerated to include significant new features, most notably the introduction of static JSON API endpoints to expose leaderboard data for external integrations. The month's capstone achievement was the integration of X (formerly Twitter) social scoring, adding a new dimension to user analytics. Throughout October, the project's data ingestion capabilities were consistently expanded by adding new repositories, projects, and plugins to the pipeline configuration.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month focused on establishing the project's core infrastructure and layering on key features for data access and user engagement.

- **Foundational System Initialization**
  - The project kicked off with the initialization of the contributor tracking system, establishing the base for all future analytics and leaderboard functionality ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/1)).

- **API and Social Scoring Features**
  - To improve interoperability, static JSON API endpoints were created, allowing programmatic access to leaderboard data for third-party applications ([#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/4)).
  - A major feature was added to integrate X social scoring, which includes OAuth linking, JWT-based verification, and an activity ingestion pipeline to track user mentions, creating a more comprehensive scoring model ([#9](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/9)).

- **Pipeline and Configuration Expansion**
  - The system's scope was steadily broadened through several configuration updates. New repositories were added to the tracker ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/2), [#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/6)), new projects were integrated into the pipeline configuration ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/3)), and a new analyser plugin was added ([#10](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/10)).

- **Workflow and Service Refinements**
  - A bug was fixed to make the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` required only for AI summary commands, streamlining the setup for users not utilizing that specific feature ([#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/5)).
  - The deployment workflow was improved to allow manual dispatch on any branch, offering greater flexibility for testing and deployment ([#8](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/8)).
