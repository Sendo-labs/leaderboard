# Sendo-labs/leaderboard Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October marked the foundational phase for the Sendo-labs/leaderboard project. Development began with the initialization of the core contributor tracking system. This was followed by progressive enhancements to the system's configuration, expanding its scope to include new repositories and projects. Towards the end of the month, a significant feature was introduced with the creation of static JSON API endpoints, enabling external applications to consume leaderboard data. A key bug fix also improved the usability of AI summary commands by making an API key requirement conditional.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month focused on establishing the leaderboard's core functionality and preparing it for broader integration.

- **System Initialization and Configuration**
  - The project kicked off with the initialization of the contributor tracking system for Sendo-labs analytics, laying the essential groundwork for all subsequent features ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/1)).
  - The system's tracking capabilities were expanded through configuration updates that added new repositories ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/2)) and integrated new projects into the pipeline configuration file ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/3)).

- **API and Command Enhancements**
  - **New Feature:** Static JSON API endpoints were added to expose leaderboard data. This enhancement improves the platform's interoperability by allowing programmatic access for external applications and third-party integrations ([#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/4)).
  - **Bug Fix:** A fix was implemented to make the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` requirement conditional, ensuring it is only necessary when executing AI summary commands. This streamlines other operations by removing an unnecessary dependency ([#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/5)).
