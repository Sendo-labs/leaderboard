# Sendo-labs/leaderboard Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October marked the inception and initial configuration of the Sendo-labs/leaderboard project. Development began with the foundational implementation of a contributor tracking system, establishing the core analytics capability.

This foundational work sets the stage for future analytics and aligns with the goal of creating a comprehensive contribution leaderboard.

New repositories were added to the tracker configuration in `config/pipeline.config.ts` ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/2)), and additional projects were integrated into the configuration pipeline to broaden tracking capabilities ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/3)).
