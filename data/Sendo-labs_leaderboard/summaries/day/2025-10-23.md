# Sendo-labs/leaderboard Daily Update (Oct 23, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, the Sendo-labs/leaderboard repository saw significant progress with the addition of JSON API endpoints for leaderboard data, enhancing external integration capabilities. A key bug fix was also implemented, streamlining AI summary commands.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Leaderboard API Enhancements
New static JSON API endpoints have been added to expose leaderboard data, facilitating programmatic access for external applications, mobile apps, and third-party integrations. This significantly improves the platform's interoperability. ([#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/4))

### AI Service Configuration Refinement
A bug was fixed to ensure that the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is only required for AI summary commands, preventing unnecessary dependency for other operations and improving system flexibility. ([#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/5))
