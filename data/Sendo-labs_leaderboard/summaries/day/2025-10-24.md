# Sendo-labs/leaderboard Daily Update (Oct 24, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on significant feature additions, including the implementation of X social scoring for user activity tracking and the ability to manually dispatch workflows on any branch. Pipeline configurations were also updated.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### X Social Scoring Integration
A major feature was added to integrate X (formerly Twitter) social scoring. This includes OAuth linking, JWT-based account verification, and an activity ingestion pipeline to track user mentions. This allows for the calculation and storage of X-based scores. ([#9](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/9))

The deployment workflow was enhanced to allow manual dispatch on any branch, providing greater flexibility for testing and deployment. Additionally, the pipeline configuration was updated to include a new Reports repository.
