# Sendo-labs/leaderboard Daily Update (Oct 24, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, significant progress was made on the leaderboard, with the introduction of X social scoring for users who link their accounts, alongside improvements to workflow dispatch capabilities.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### X Social Scoring Integration
A major feature was added to integrate X (formerly Twitter) social scoring. This includes OAuth linking, JWT-based account verification, and an activity ingestion pipeline to track user mentions. This allows for a more comprehensive scoring system based on social engagement. ([#9](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/9))

### Workflow and Pipeline Enhancements
The deployment workflow was enhanced to allow manual dispatch on any branch, providing greater flexibility for testing and deployment. Additionally, a new repository for reports was added to the pipeline configuration. ([#8](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/8), [#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/6))
