# Sendo-labs/leaderboard Weekly Report (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's development focused on expanding the leaderboard's data integration capabilities and improving its usability. The most significant achievement was the introduction of static JSON API endpoints, enabling external applications to programmatically access leaderboard data. Work also included expanding the system's tracking scope by adding new repositories and projects to the configuration. A key bug fix was also implemented, streamlining the developer workflow by making the AI service API key conditional.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week progressed from foundational configuration updates to significant feature enhancements and bug fixes.

-   **API for External Integrations:** A major feature was added to expose leaderboard data through new static JSON API endpoints. This enhancement ([#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/4)) is a crucial step towards interoperability, allowing third-party applications and mobile clients to consume the data.

-   **Expanded Project Tracking:** The system's configuration was updated to broaden its tracking capabilities. This included adding new repositories to the tracker configuration file ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/2)) and integrating new projects into the pipeline configuration ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/3)), supporting the platform's modularity and scalability.

-   **AI Service Dependency Fix:** A bug was fixed to make the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` requirement conditional. This change ([#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/5)) ensures the key is only necessary when running AI summary commands, improving the experience for users performing other operations.
