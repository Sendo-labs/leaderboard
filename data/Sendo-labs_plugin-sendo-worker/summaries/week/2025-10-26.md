# Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker Weekly Report (Oct 26 - 1, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts were concentrated on establishing a robust foundation for the `plugin-sendo-worker` project, enhancing stability and developer velocity. A comprehensive testing infrastructure, featuring 98 automated tests, was integrated to ensure code quality and prevent regressions. The development pipeline was significantly streamlined through the implementation of automated GitHub Actions for NPM publishing and release management. Key refactoring work was also completed to align the codebase with official APIs, improving overall maintainability and preparing the project for future development.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this period focused on building out essential development infrastructure and refining the existing codebase.

### Enhanced Testing and CI/CD Automation
A major effort was made to bolster project reliability and automate the deployment process.
- A robust testing system with 98 automated tests, including real runtime testing, was established to catch regressions and ensure stability ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/2)).
- New GitHub Actions workflows were implemented to fully automate NPM publishing and release changelog generation, streamlining the deployment cycle ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/3), [#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/5)).

### API Refactoring and Code Maintenance
The codebase was improved to align with best practices and external APIs.
- The plugin was refactored to use the official Eliza `getActionResults` API, moving away from internal `stateCache` access. This change also introduced proper `HandlerOptions` typing in test helpers and corrected parameter formats in fixtures ([#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/4)).
- Minor housekeeping tasks were completed, including updates to `bun.lock` and `package-lock.json` ([#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/6)) and additions to the `.gitignore` file ([#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/7)).
