# Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker Weekly Report (Oct 26 - 1, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was pivotal for establishing project maturity and planning future architecture. The team implemented a comprehensive testing infrastructure with 98 automated tests and fully automated the NPM publishing and release workflows, culminating in the v1.0.0 release. Towards the end of the week, focus shifted to future development with a new pull request aimed at a significant architectural refactor of the `SendoWorkerService` and the integration of full wallet functionality.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on building a stable foundation for development and deployment, while also initiating a major architectural overhaul.

### Project Automation & Stability
A series of foundational improvements were merged to enhance repository hygiene, testing reliability, and deployment efficiency.
- **Testing Infrastructure:** A comprehensive testing system with 98 automated tests, including real runtime testing, was established to ensure stability and prevent regressions ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/2)).
- **Automated Releases:** GitHub Actions workflows were implemented to automate NPM package publishing, changelog generation, and release management, streamlining the deployment process ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/3), [#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/5), [#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/6)).
- **Code Refactoring & Environment:** The codebase was refactored to use the official Eliza `getActionResults` API, and test helpers were improved with proper typing ([#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/4)). The `.gitignore` file was also updated to improve development environment consistency ([#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/7)).

### Architectural Refactoring (In Progress)
A new effort has begun to evolve the core architecture of the service.
- A significant pull request was opened to refactor the `SendoWorkerService` into more focused, modular components and to implement full wallet integration, laying the groundwork for future capabilities ([#8](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/8)).
