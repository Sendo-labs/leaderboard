# Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker Weekly Report (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was marked by a significant milestone in the project's development with the initial implementation of the Sendo Worker orchestrator. This foundational work establishes the core components for intelligent trading, introducing a dynamic analysis engine designed to discover agent capabilities and generate LLM-powered actionable recommendations. Following this major feature implementation, work immediately began on establishing a robust testing infrastructure to ensure the reliability and correctness of the new system. The focus was clearly on building out core functionality, laying the groundwork for the platform's autonomous and adaptive capabilities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Development this week centered on the creation of the Sendo Worker, a new core component of the platform.

- **Initial Sendo Worker Implementation:** A major effort culminated in the initial implementation of the Sendo Worker orchestrator ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/1)). This new feature includes several key components:
    - **Core Logic:** A dynamic analysis engine that discovers agent capabilities, executes analysis actions, and generates recommendations.
    - **AI Prompt System:** A comprehensive set of templates was added to manage interactions with the LLM for tasks like action categorization, analysis, and recommendation generation.
    - **Data Structures:** New API definitions, schemas, and types were introduced to support the worker's analysis results and recommended actions.

- **Test Infrastructure:** Following the initial implementation, a new pull request ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/2)) was opened to add a comprehensive test infrastructure, including real runtime testing, to validate the new orchestrator's functionality.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The project saw a quiet week on the issue tracking front, with development focused on the new feature implementation.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.
- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were reported, and there were no active issues with significant discussion, indicating a stable period focused on planned development.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Based on the development reports, this week's activity was characterized by focused, heads-down work on a single, large-scale feature. The completion of the initial Sendo Worker implementation ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/1)) and the immediate follow-up with a PR for testing infrastructure ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/2)) suggests a methodical and planned development workflow.
