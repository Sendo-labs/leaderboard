# Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October marked the foundational launch of the Sendo Worker plugin. The primary achievement was the initial implementation of the core Sendo Worker orchestrator, a significant step towards our goal of creating an extensible AI agent framework. This new engine enables dynamic analysis of agent capabilities and generates actionable, LLM-powered recommendations. Following this major implementation, work immediately began on establishing a comprehensive testing infrastructure to ensure the reliability of these new features.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Development this month was focused on establishing the core functionality of the plugin.

- **Initial Sendo Worker Implementation**
  The foundational feature of the plugin was merged, introducing the Sendo Worker orchestrator ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/1)). This core component is designed for the dynamic analysis of agent capabilities, the execution of analysis actions, and the generation of recommendations using an LLM. The implementation included a comprehensive set of files for configuration, services, schemas, and various prompt templates to power the AI-driven analysis.

- **Test Infrastructure Initiated**
  To support the new orchestrator, a pull request was opened to add a full test infrastructure to the project ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/2)). This effort includes provisions for real runtime testing, laying the groundwork for future stability and quality assurance.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The project's issue tracker remained quiet during this period, reflecting the focused effort on initial feature development.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed in October.
- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were reported, and there were no active issues with significant discussion.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month was centered on the initial push to build and stabilize the plugin's core. The development activity was concentrated on two key pull requests: one for the initial implementation and another to establish a testing framework.
