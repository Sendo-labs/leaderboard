# Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October marked a significant milestone for the project with the initial implementation of the Sendo Worker orchestrator. This foundational work establishes the core dynamic analysis engine, which is designed to discover agent capabilities, execute analysis, and generate actionable, LLM-powered recommendations for intelligent trading. The effort included defining the necessary API structures and developing a comprehensive prompt and template system to drive the worker's AI capabilities. With this core functionality in place, development has already shifted towards building out a robust testing infrastructure.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Development this month was centered on establishing the foundational components of the Sendo Worker.

- **Initial Sendo Worker Implementation ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/1))**
  A major pull request laid the groundwork for the entire plugin. This new feature includes:
    - **Core Orchestrator:** The initial version of the Sendo Worker orchestrator and its dynamic analysis engine was implemented.
    - **LLM Prompt System:** A comprehensive set of templates for LLM interactions was added to facilitate action categorization, analysis generation, and recommendation selection.
    - **API & Data Structures:** New schemas and types were defined to support analysis results, recommended actions, and the overall generation process.

- **Test Infrastructure Initiative**
  Following the initial implementation, work has begun on creating a comprehensive test infrastructure. A new pull request ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/2)) was opened to add real runtime testing capabilities, ensuring the stability and reliability of the new orchestrator.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The issue tracker remained quiet during this development period, with the focus squarely on the initial feature implementation.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed in this timeframe.
- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were reported, and there were no active issues with significant ongoing discussion.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
While the provided reports do not contain specific details on contributor discussions, the development pattern indicates a highly focused effort. The completion of a large, foundational pull request ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/1)) followed immediately by the initiation of a testing framework ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/2)) suggests a methodical and structured approach to building out the project's core features.
