# Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October was a foundational month for the Sendo Worker plugin, marked by the initial implementation of its core architecture. The team successfully launched the Sendo Worker orchestrator, a dynamic analysis engine designed to discover agent capabilities and generate LLM-powered recommendations. This foundational work was immediately fortified by a significant push for stability and developer efficiency, including the integration of a comprehensive testing suite with 98 automated tests. The month concluded with the establishment of automated release workflows and initial refactoring efforts to prepare for future feature enhancements.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Development this month focused on building the core service and establishing a robust development and deployment pipeline.

### Core Sendo Worker Implementation
The project kicked off with the initial implementation of the Sendo Worker orchestrator. This foundational effort established the dynamic analysis engine, which is responsible for executing analysis actions and generating actionable trading recommendations. This work also included a comprehensive set of LLM prompt templates for various AI interactions and the definition of core API schemas and data structures for analysis results and actions ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/1)).

### Testing Infrastructure and Code Refinement
A major focus was placed on ensuring project stability and quality. A comprehensive testing system with 98 automated tests, including real runtime testing, was integrated to prevent regressions and support reliable development cycles ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/2)). In a related effort, the codebase was refactored to use the official Eliza `getActionResults` API, improving maintainability and consistency ([#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/4)).

### Automated Release and Publishing Workflows
To streamline deployments, new GitHub Actions workflows were implemented to automate NPM package publishing and release management, complete with changelog generation ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/3), [#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/5), [#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/6)). As part of this process, the project was bumped to version 1.0.0. The development environment was also improved with updates to the `.gitignore` file ([#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/7)).

### Architectural Improvements
Towards the end of the month, work began on modularizing the architecture. A pull request was opened to refactor the `SendoWorkerService` into more focused modules and to implement full wallet integration, setting the stage for future capabilities ([#8](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/8)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The project's issue tracker remained quiet during this period.

-   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed in October.
-   **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were reported, and there were no active issues with significant discussion. Development appears to be driven by planned features via pull requests rather than reactive bug fixing.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The development activity in October suggests a highly focused and coordinated effort. The rapid progression from initial implementation ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/1)) to comprehensive testing ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/2)) and deployment automation ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/3), [#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/5), [#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/6)) indicates a methodical approach to building a stable foundation. The opening of new pull requests for testing and refactoring ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/2), [#8](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/8)) points to an active internal review process.
