# Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker Daily Update (Oct 26, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, the team significantly enhanced the project's stability and development pipeline by implementing a comprehensive testing infrastructure with 98 automated tests and establishing automated NPM publishing and release workflows.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Robust Testing Infrastructure Established
A comprehensive testing system was integrated, featuring 98 automated tests that cover critical functionalities. This includes real runtime testing to ensure stability and prevent regressions, allowing for faster and more reliable development cycles. ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/2))

### Refactored API Usage and Test Helpers
The codebase was refactored to utilize the official Eliza `getActionResults` API, replacing internal `stateCache` access. This change improves consistency and maintainability. Additionally, proper `HandlerOptions` typing was added to test helpers, and fixture parameters were fixed to align with Zod schemas. ([#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/4))

### Automated Release and Publishing Workflows
New GitHub Actions workflows were implemented to automate NPM package publishing and release management. This includes configuration for release versions and changelog generation, streamlining the deployment process. A bump to version 1.0.0 was also performed. ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/3), [#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/5), [#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/6))

### Enhanced Development Environment Configuration
The `.gitignore` file was updated to include `.env.test` and new directories for plugin specifications and scripts, improving repository hygiene and development environment consistency. ([#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/7))
