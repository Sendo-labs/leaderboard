# Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker Daily Update (Oct 26, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, the team significantly enhanced the project's stability and development pipeline by implementing a comprehensive testing infrastructure with 98 automated tests and establishing automated NPM publishing and release workflows.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Robust Testing Infrastructure Established
A bulletproof testing system was integrated, featuring 98 automated tests covering critical functionalities. This includes real runtime testing to ensure stability and prevent regressions, allowing for faster and more reliable development cycles. ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/2))

### Refactored API Usage and Test Helpers
The codebase was refactored to utilize the official Eliza `getActionResults` API, replacing internal `stateCache` access. This update also included adding proper `HandlerOptions` typing in test helpers and fixing parameter formats in fixtures to align with Zod schemas. ([#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/4))

This includes configuration files for release versions and changelog generation, streamlining the deployment process.

### Minor Fixes and Housekeeping
A minor fix was applied to update `bun.lock` and `package-lock.json` files. Additionally, the `.gitignore` file was updated to include `.env.test` and new directories for plugin specifications and scripts.
