This foundational work successfully brought the project from concept to a tangible, multi-repository ecosystem, setting a rapid pace for future development.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Launching the ElizaOS Ecosystem**\n*To realize our vision of a modular AI agent framework, we first needed to build the core components that will power agent interactions and user experiences.*\n-   The main backend API was launched, complete with extensive capabilities for decoding blockchain transactions from protocols like Jupiter, Orca, and Raydium ([Sendo-labs/sendo-api](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api)).\n-   The user-facing application was established and architected on a modern Next.js foundation, ready for building out the agent chat interface ([Sendo-labs/frontend](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend)).\n-   The initial engine for analyzing agent capabilities was created, providing a core mechanism for agents to understand and recommend actions ([Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker)).\n\n**Enabling Web3 Agent Functionality**\n*A central goal of ElizaOS is to create agents that can operate effectively in decentralized ecosystems, requiring the ability to interact with blockchains and Web3 data.*\n-   Work began on direct blockchain interaction with the implementation of core logic for SOL transfers on the Solana network ([Sendo-labs/spotlight](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/spotlight)).\n-   A new plugin was developed to allow agents to retrieve wallet and token reputation data from the CryptoScore API, enriching their decision-making capabilities ([Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore)).\n-   A critical bug in the trading logic was fixed early on, ensuring the reliability of core buy/sell functions within the API ([Sendo-labs/sendo-api](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api)).\n\n**Building for Scalability and Open Collaboration**\n*To support a growing open-source community, we are building automated and scalable systems for project releases, contribution tracking, and accessibility from day one.*\n-   A central repository for reusable release workflows was created, enabling standardized and automated software publishing across all our projects ([Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows)).\n-   A new contributor tracking system was established to provide analytics on project activity and recognize community contributions ([Sendo-labs/leaderboard](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard)).\n-   The project was made more accessible to a global audience by translating key documentation into English ([Sendo-labs/sendo-api](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\nThis month's foundational work included early integration efforts to ensure our components work together and follow consistent development practices.\n-   **Standardized Release Automation:** The new `reusable-workflows` repository provided a standardized automation pipeline that was immediately adopted by `plugin-cryptoscore` to manage its first release and publish to NPM.\n-   **Frontend-Backend Integration:** The `frontend` team began integrating with the newly created `sendo-api`, building the hooks and components necessary to connect the user interface with the backend agent logic.\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### Sendo-labs/frontend\n-   Initialized the project and performed a major architectural migration to Next.js 15 and Bun, establishing a modern and robust foundation for the user interface ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/1), [#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/3)).\n-   Began building the core user experience by creating custom hooks (`useElizaAgent.js`, `useElizaChat.js`) and UI components for agent and chat management ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/2)).\n-   Improved the developer workflow by adding missing dependencies and creating an environment file template to streamline setup ([#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/4), [#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/5)).\n\n### Sendo-labs/sendo-api\n-   Established the project's foundational architecture in a comprehensive initial commit, including API controllers, service integrations, and extensive transaction decoding utilities for multiple blockchain protocols ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/1)).\n-   Addressed a critical bug in buy/sell account operations to ensure the reliability of core trading functionality from the start ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/3)).\n-   Translated the `README.md` into English to make the project's goals and setup instructions more accessible to a global community ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/sendo-api/pull/2)).\n\n### Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore\n-   Completed the initial implementation of the plugin, enabling the retrieval of token and wallet scores via the CryptoScore API ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/1)).\n-   Established a robust, automated release process using GitHub Actions to manage changelogs and publish the package to NPM ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/2), [#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/5), [#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/6)).\n\n### Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker\n-   Implemented the initial version of the Sendo Worker, creating the core engine for dynamic analysis of agent capabilities and the generation of LLM-powered recommendations ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-worker/pull/1)).\n\n### Sendo-labs/spotlight\n-   Initiated development of the project's Web3 capabilities by implementing and testing the core logic for SOL transfers on the Solana blockchain ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/spotlight/pull/1)).\n\n### Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows\n-   Created and implemented core reusable workflows for automating project releases and npm publishing, establishing a standardized CI/CD pipeline for the ecosystem ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows/pull/1)).\n-   Successfully validated the new automation by managing the repository's own initial v1.0.0 release ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows/pull/2), [#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/reusable-workflows/pull/3)).\n\n### Sendo-labs/leaderboard\n-   Launched the project by initializing a contributor tracking system to provide analytics on development activity across the organization ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/leaderboard/pull/1)).\n-   Expanded the system's scope by adding
