The team successfully executed a major migration from a Vite+React stack to Next.js 15, establishing a new technical baseline that includes Bun for package management and Biome for code quality. Following this migration, efforts focused on stabilizing the new environment through dependency management and configuration updates. The week concluded with substantial UI/UX enhancements, introducing a standardized page layout component and a new onboarding experience, setting the stage for more robust feature development.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week centered on migrating the entire application to a new framework and then building upon that new foundation with UI improvements and maintenance.\n\n- **Foundational Migration to Next.js 15**\n  The most critical effort was the complete refactoring of the project from Vite+React to a Next.js 15 application. This change introduced Bun as the package manager and Biome for linting and formatting, overhauling the project's core structure and configuration ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/1)). In preparation for leveraging the new framework's capabilities, page structures were improved to support server-side data fetching, moving the project closer to recovering real user data from the agent instead of relying on mocks ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/3)).\n\n- **UI/UX Enhancements and Refactoring**\n  Significant progress was made on improving the user experience and code maintainability. A new `PageWrapper` component was introduced to standardize layouts and styling across the `analyzer`, `leaderboard`, `worker`, and a new `onboarding` page, ensuring a consistent look and feel ([#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/7)). The `worker-plugin` also received a refactor, specifically improving the readability of the `RuleBuilder` component by updating label elements and formatting ([#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/6)).\n\n- **Project Maintenance and Configuration**\n  To support the new Next.js environment, several maintenance tasks were completed. Missing dependencies were added to `bun.lock` and `package.json` to prevent build issues ([#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/5)). Configuration management was also improved by updating `.gitignore` to properly handle local environment files and by creating an `.env.example` file to serve as a template for contributors ([#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/4)).\n\n- **New Feature Initiation**\n  Work began on a new feature with the opening of a pull request to implement worker functionality ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/2)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nThe issue tracker remained quiet this week, with development focused on implementing changes via pull requests.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were reported, and there were no noteworthy discussions on existing issues.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nDevelopment progressed steadily through a series of focused pull requests.
