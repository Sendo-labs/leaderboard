This major refactoring sets a new technical direction for the project, enabling improved page structures and data fetching strategies in preparation for integrating real user data. Following the migration, efforts focused on stabilizing the new development environment and beginning to enhance the user experience with a standardized page layout, a new onboarding flow, and several UI refinements.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week centered on the migration to Next.js and subsequent improvements to the codebase and user interface.\n\n### Foundational Migration to Next.js\nThe most impactful change was the complete migration from a Vite+React setup to a Next.js 15 application. This involved a major project-wide refactoring, updating configurations, and introducing Biome for linting and formatting ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/1)). In parallel, the page structure was enhanced to align with Next.js best practices for data fetching, laying the groundwork for a better data recovery strategy and moving away from mocked data ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/3)).\n\n### Development Environment Stabilization\nFollowing the migration, work was done to ensure a stable and consistent development environment. This included adding missing dependencies to `package.json` to prevent build issues ([#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/5)). Additionally, environment file handling was improved by updating `.gitignore` to manage local configurations (`.env.local`) and creating an `.env.example` template for new contributors ([#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/4)).\n\n### UI/UX Enhancements and Refinements\nSeveral changes were made to improve application consistency and user experience. A new shared `PageWrapper` component was introduced to standardize the layout across the `analyzer`, `leaderboard`, `worker`, and a new `onboarding` page ([#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/7)). The `worker-plugin`'s `RuleBuilder` component was refactored for better code readability ([#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/6)). Finally, the UI was simplified by removing the 'accepted' status from the `ActionHistory` component for greater clarity ([#8](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/8)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were reported this week. There were no active issues with significant discussion.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nDevelopment activity was steady and focused, driven by the major migration effort. A new pull request ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/2)) was opened early in the week to implement worker functionality, indicating ongoing feature development. The subsequent pull requests show a logical progression of work, with developers first establishing the new foundation and then moving to stabilize the environment and enhance the UI.

The month was defined by rapid architectural evolution, most notably a strategic migration from a Vite+React setup to Next.js 15. This pivotal change was undertaken to prepare for robust data recovery strategies and future integration of real user data. Following the migration, development shifted towards building out core agent functionalities with Eliza API integration and enhancing user experience through standardized layouts and a new onboarding flow.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month focused on establishing a strong technical foundation and building out initial features.\n\n### Project Initialization and Architectural Migration\nThe project was officially launched with an initial commit that laid out the entire frontend application, including API client structures and an extensive set of UI components ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/1)). Shortly after, a significant refactoring effort migrated the entire codebase from Vite+React to Next.js 15. This move was aimed at leveraging Next.js's data fetching capabilities and aligning the project with a more robust structure for future development, specifically to move beyond mocked data ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/1), [#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/3)).\n\n### Core Agent and Chat Functionality\nEarly development focused on integrating the Eliza API to power agent interactions. This involved adding core dependencies and creating custom hooks (`useElizaAgent.js`, `useElizaChat.js`) to manage agent and chat logic. To support this, essential UI components such as `AgentSidebar.jsx` and `ChatInterface.jsx` were also developed ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/2)).\n\n### UI/UX Enhancements and Refinements\nTo create a more consistent user experience, a shared `PageWrapper` component was introduced and applied across key pages like `analyzer`, `leaderboard`, and `worker`. A new `onboarding` page was also created to guide new users ([#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/7)). The `worker-plugin`'s `RuleBuilder` component was refactored for improved code clarity and readability ([#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/6)). In a minor UI refinement, the 'accepted' status was removed from the `ActionHistory` component to simplify status handling ([#8](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/8)).\n\n### Development Environment and Stability\nFollowing the migration to Next.js, work was done to stabilize the development environment. This included adding missing dependencies to `package.json` to prevent build issues ([#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/5)) and refining the `.gitignore` and `.env.example` files for better management of local environment configurations ([#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/4)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nThe project is in its initial bootstrap phase, and development appears to be driven directly through pull requests rather than a formal issue-tracking process.\n\n-   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed in October.\n-   **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were reported, and there were no active issues with significant discussion during this period.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nAs a new project, the development activity in October reflects a concentrated, foundational push.
