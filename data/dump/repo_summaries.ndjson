The month began with a comprehensive initial commit that laid out a component-driven structure and API client patterns. A significant strategic pivot occurred mid-month with a migration from a Vite+React setup to a Next.js 15 application. This architectural shift, which included adopting Bun and Biome, was undertaken to better support server-side data fetching and future data recovery strategies. Alongside these foundational changes, initial development began on integrating the Eliza API for agent and chat management.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month focused on establishing a robust foundation for the frontend application, including a major architectural migration to better suit the project's long-term goals.\n\n### Project Initialization and Foundational Architecture\nThe project was officially kicked off with an initial commit that established a comprehensive codebase ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/1)). This included a vast library of UI components for agent management, marketplace features, and general use, indicating a component-driven approach from the start. Initial API client structures were also put in place, preparing for future backend communication.\n\n### Architectural Migration to Next.js\nA major refactoring effort was undertaken to migrate the application from Vite+React to Next.js 15.
