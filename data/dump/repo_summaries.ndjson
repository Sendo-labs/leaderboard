This major refactoring sets a new technical direction for the project, enabling improved page structures and data fetching strategies in preparation for integrating real user data. Following the migration, efforts focused on stabilizing the new development environment and beginning to enhance the user experience with a standardized page layout, a new onboarding flow, and several UI refinements.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week centered on the migration to Next.js and subsequent improvements to the codebase and user interface.\n\n### Foundational Migration to Next.js\nThe most impactful change was the complete migration from a Vite+React setup to a Next.js 15 application. This involved a major project-wide refactoring, updating configurations, and introducing Biome for linting and formatting ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/1)). In parallel, the page structure was enhanced to align with Next.js best practices for data fetching, laying the groundwork for a better data recovery strategy and moving away from mocked data ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/3)).\n\n### Development Environment Stabilization\nFollowing the migration, work was done to ensure a stable and consistent development environment. This included adding missing dependencies to `package.json` to prevent build issues ([#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/5)). Additionally, environment file handling was improved by updating `.gitignore` to manage local configurations (`.env.local`) and creating an `.env.example` template for new contributors ([#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/4)).\n\n### UI/UX Enhancements and Refinements\nSeveral changes were made to improve application consistency and user experience. A new shared `PageWrapper` component was introduced to standardize the layout across the `analyzer`, `leaderboard`, `worker`, and a new `onboarding` page ([#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/7)). The `worker-plugin`'s `RuleBuilder` component was refactored for better code readability ([#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/6)). Finally, the UI was simplified by removing the 'accepted' status from the `ActionHistory` component for greater clarity ([#8](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/8)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were reported this week.

This intensive period of building has laid a strong technical groundwork for the personal AI agent platform.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nThis month's work centered on establishing the project's architecture and rolling out initial core features.\n\n-   **Project Foundation and Architectural Migration**\n    The repository was born with an initial commit that included a comprehensive set of UI components, API client structures, and project configurations ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/1)). Shortly after, a significant architectural decision was made to migrate the entire application from Vite+React to Next.js 15. This effort involved a major refactoring to align with Next.js best practices, update configurations, and improve the page structure for a better data recovery strategy, moving away from mocked data ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/1), [#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/3)).\n\n-   **Worker System Implementation**\n    A major focus was the implementation of the \"worker\" system. Initial work laid the groundwork for worker functionality, introducing new components and services ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/2)). This was followed by refinements to the worker plugin's `RuleBuilder` for better code clarity ([#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/6)), a refactor of the worker client to streamline polling logic and automate analysis suggestions ([#12](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/12)), and the addition of a worker creation feature ([#16](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/16)).

The project integrated Eliza API dependencies and developed custom hooks (`useElizaAgent.js`, `useElizaChat.js`) to manage agent and chat functionalities ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/2)). The user-facing agent interface was enhanced by replacing the old `AgentPanel` with a new, more interactive `AgentChat` component ([#13](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/13)). Late in the month, the `merge-analyzer` feature was integrated, introducing client-side components and services for trade analysis ([#17](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/17)), with minor UI refinements to its error displays ([#18](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/18)).\n\n-   **User Authentication**\n    A critical step towards user management and security was taken with the integration of Privy for client-side and server-side authentication. This involved adding new dependencies, configurations, and dedicated logic for session handling, impacting numerous components to support the new authentication flows ([#10](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/10)).\n\n-   **Code Health and Environment Stability**\n    Throughout the month, there was a consistent effort to improve code quality and the development environment.

Significant progress was made on the AgentAI experience, with the introduction of a new agent chat interface, streamlined worker creation, and the successful integration of the trade analyzer feature. A parallel focus on code quality and refactoring ensured that these new features were built on a consistent and maintainable codebase, paving the way for more advanced agent capabilities.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week focused on shipping major new features while simultaneously improving the underlying code structure.\n\n- **Authentication and Security**\n    - A comprehensive authentication system was integrated using Privy, enabling both client-side and server-side session management. This crucial update involved modifying core components, providers, and environment configurations to establish a secure user foundation ([#10](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/10)).\n\n- **Agent & Worker Enhancements**\n    - The user experience for interacting with agents was significantly upgraded by replacing the old `AgentPanel` with a new, more interactive `AgentChat` component ([#13](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/13)).\n    - The worker analysis workflow was refactored to be more efficient, replacing a manual suggestion button with automatic polling for analysis results ([#12](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/12)).\n    - A new feature for worker creation was introduced ([#16](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/16)), and a pull request for `worker-code` was opened ([#14](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/14)), advancing the project's goal of allowing users to build their own AgentAIs.\n\n- **Analyzer Feature Integration**\n    - The `analyzer` feature was merged into the main branch, introducing a suite of new client-side components and services for trade analysis. This includes new UI for performance metrics and services to handle trade data ([#17](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/17)). Minor follow-up refinements were made to improve the display of error messages ([#18](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/18)).\n\n- **Code Quality and Refactoring**\n    - A significant effort was dedicated to improving code quality across the repository. This included extensive reformatting, standardizing indentation, and ensuring consistent `async/await` syntax across agent, analyzer, and service files ([#11](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/11), [#15](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/15), [#16](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/frontend/pull/16)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed this week.\n- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were reported this week. There were no active issues with significant discussion, indicating a development focus on implementing planned features via pull requests.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nDevelopment activity was high this week, with a clear focus on shipping code and merging features. The work spanned multiple core areas of the application\u2014from backend authentication to frontend agent interaction and data analysis\u2014suggesting a coordinated effort across the team. The provided reports do not indicate any pull requests or issues with a high degree of public discussion, pointing to a period of focused implementation.", "2025-11-02T01:13:46.038Z"]
