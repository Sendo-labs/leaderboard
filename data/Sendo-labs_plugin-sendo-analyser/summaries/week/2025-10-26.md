# Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser Weekly Report (Oct 26 - 1, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week marked a significant milestone for the Sendo Analyser plugin, with the complete migration of the `sendo-api` functionality into the ElizaOS plugin architecture. This foundational work introduced a suite of new REST API endpoints for comprehensive wallet analysis. Development then shifted towards stabilization and modernization, with updates to dependencies, integration of the latest Sendo API changes, and the implementation of cursor-based pagination. The week concluded by focusing on operational maturity, with new work initiated to establish automated release and publishing workflows.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on integrating core API functionality, enhancing performance, and preparing the project for automated releases.

-   **Core API Migration and Expansion:** The most substantial effort was the full migration of `sendo-api` functionality into the plugin. This introduced seven new REST API endpoints for `/signatures`, `/trades`, `/transactions`, `/tokens`, `/nfts`, `/global`, and `/wallet`, along with the core `SendoAnalyserService` ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/1)). Following this, the plugin was updated to integrate with the latest version of the Sendo API, ensuring compatibility with new features ([#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/6)).

-   **Performance and Usability Enhancements:** To improve data handling for large datasets, cursor-based pagination was added to the `/trades`, `/signatures`, and `/transactions` endpoints ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/3)). A separate effort focused on maintenance, updating dependencies and enhancing core service files like `birdeyes.ts`, `helius.ts`, and `sendoAnalyserService.ts` to ensure stability and performance ([#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/5)).

-   **Project Maintenance and Automation:** The project saw several version bumps, moving from 1.1.0 to 1.3.0 to reflect the rapid feature additions ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/3), [#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/7)). Documentation was improved with a comprehensive `README.md` update ([#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/4)), and a fix was applied to `package.json` ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/2)). Towards the end of the week, work began on automating the deployment process with a new pull request to configure release and publishing workflows ([#8](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/8)).
