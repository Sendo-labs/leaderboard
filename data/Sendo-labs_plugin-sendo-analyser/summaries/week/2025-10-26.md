# Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser Weekly Report (Oct 26 - 1, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week marked a significant milestone in establishing the `plugin-sendo-analyser` as a core component of the ElizaOS ecosystem. Development was characterized by a major migration of the entire `sendo-api` functionality directly into the plugin, immediately followed by API enhancements like cursor-based pagination. The remainder of the week focused on continuous integration and maintenance, ensuring the plugin stayed current with the latest Sendo API updates and external dependencies. The rapid succession of version bumps to 1.1.0 and then 1.3.0 reflects a period of intense feature development and release preparation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on building out the plugin's core functionality, enhancing its API, and ensuring its stability and compatibility.

-   **Core Functionality Migration and API Expansion:** The most substantial effort was the complete migration of `sendo-api` functionality into the ElizaOS plugin. This foundational work introduced the `SendoAnalyserService` and established 7 new REST API endpoints for `/signatures`, `/trades`, `/transactions`, `/tokens`, `/nfts`, `/global`, and `/wallet`, enabling comprehensive wallet analysis ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/1)).

-   **API Enhancements and Service Integration:** Following the migration, the API was immediately improved by adding cursor-based pagination to the `/trades`, `/signatures`, and `/transactions` endpoints ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/3)). Further work involved updating dependencies and enhancing the core service logic, including its integrations with Birdeyes and Helius, to ensure stability ([#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/5)). The plugin was also updated to consume the latest version of the Sendo API, ensuring compatibility across the platform ([#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/6)).

-   **Documentation and Versioning:** To support the new features, the `README.md` was updated with comprehensive plugin details ([#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/4)), and a fix was applied to the `package.json` file ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/2)). The project's version was bumped twice, first to 1.1.0 and later to 1.3.0, signaling the integration of significant new features and preparation for upcoming releases ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/3), [#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/7)).
