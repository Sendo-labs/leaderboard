# Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October was a foundational month for the Sendo Analyser plugin, marked by the successful migration of the entire `sendo-api` functionality into the ElizaOS plugin architecture. This core effort established a comprehensive suite of REST API endpoints for wallet analysis. Subsequent work focused on refining this new foundation by introducing cursor-based pagination, updating dependencies, and integrating the latest API changes. The month concluded with efforts to streamline future development by establishing automated release and publishing workflows.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Development this month centered on building out the plugin's core features and ensuring its stability and maintainability.

-   **Core API Implementation:** The most significant effort was the complete migration of `sendo-api` functionality into the plugin. This introduced the `SendoAnalyserService` and established 7 new REST API endpoints for `/signatures`, `/trades`, `/transactions`, `/tokens`, `/nfts`, `/global`, and `/wallet`, providing a comprehensive interface for on-chain data analysis ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/1)).

-   **API Enhancements and Maintenance:** Following the initial implementation, several enhancements were made to improve performance and usability. Cursor-based pagination was added to the `/trades`, `/signatures`, and `/transactions` endpoints ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/3)). The plugin was also updated to use the latest Sendo API, ensuring compatibility with new features related to trade parsing and rate limiting ([#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/6)). A general dependency update was performed to keep the plugin robust and secure ([#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/5)).

-   **Project Infrastructure and Versioning:** To support the rapid development, the project's infrastructure was improved. The `README.md` was updated with comprehensive plugin details ([#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/4)), and a fix was applied to `package.json` ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/2)). The plugin's version was bumped twice, first to v1.1.0 and later to v1.3.0, reflecting the significant feature additions ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/3), [#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/7)). Towards the end of the month, work began on setting up release configurations and automated publishing workflows ([#8](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/8)).
