# Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October marked a foundational month for the `plugin-sendo-analyser`, centered on its initial creation and core feature implementation. The most significant achievement was the complete migration of the `sendo-api` functionality into a new ElizaOS plugin, establishing a comprehensive suite of analysis endpoints. This foundational work was immediately followed by key API enhancements, including the introduction of cursor-based pagination to improve data handling for large datasets. The month's efforts successfully launched the plugin with a robust set of features, ready for further development.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Development this month focused on establishing the plugin's core architecture and API surface.

### Core Functionality Migration
The primary effort involved migrating the entire `sendo-api` into the new plugin architecture. This foundational work introduced the `SendoAnalyserService`, which provides wallet analysis methods and support for multi-protocol transactions. As part of this migration, 7 new REST API endpoints were created: `/signatures`, `/trades`, `/transactions`, `/tokens`, `/nfts`, `/global`, and `/wallet`, laying the groundwork for all subsequent analysis features ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/1)).

### API Enhancements and Fixes
Following the initial migration, the API was enhanced for better usability and scalability. The project version was bumped to 1.1.0, and cursor-based pagination was implemented for the `/trades`, `/signatures`, and `/transactions` endpoints, ensuring efficient data retrieval. Service methods were updated accordingly to return pagination metadata alongside results ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/3)). A minor fix was also applied to the `package.json` file ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/2)).

### Documentation
To support the new functionality, the `README.md` file was updated with comprehensive details about the plugin's features and usage, ensuring clarity for contributors and users ([#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/4)).
