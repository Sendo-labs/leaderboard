# Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser Daily Update (Oct 26, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on migrating the complete `sendo-api` functionality into the ElizaOS plugin, enhancing API endpoints with pagination, and updating documentation.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Plugin Implementation and API Expansion
The `sendo-api` functionality has been fully migrated into the ElizaOS plugin, introducing 7 new REST API endpoints for `/signatures`, `/trades`, `/transactions`, `/tokens`, `/nfts`, `/global`, and `/wallet`. This includes the `SendoAnalyserService` with wallet analysis methods and multi-protocol transaction support. ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/1))

### API Pagination and Version Update
The plugin's version has been bumped to 1.1.0. API endpoints for trades, signatures, and transactions now support cursor-based pagination, and service methods have been updated to include pagination metadata. ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/3))

### Documentation and Package Fixes
The `README.md` has been updated with comprehensive plugin details to improve clarity and usability. A fix was also implemented for the `package.json` file. ([#4](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/4), [#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-sendo-analyser/pull/2))
