# Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October marked the inception of the CryptoScore plugin for ElizaOS. Development began with the foundational implementation of the plugin, establishing core functionalities for retrieving token and wallet scores via the CryptoScore API. Following this initial setup, the focus shifted to building a robust operational backbone. A significant effort was made to create automated release management and NPM publishing workflows, ensuring a streamlined and reliable deployment process for future versions. This foundational work culminated in preparations for the initial `1.0.0` release.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month was centered on two primary themes: initial feature implementation and the establishment of deployment infrastructure.

- **Initial Plugin Implementation**
  The project kicked off with the creation of the CryptoScore plugin's core structure. This initial version introduced the primary capabilities for AI agents to analyze cryptocurrency data, including services for retrieving token scores and performing wallet analysis. The work also involved integrating with the external CryptoScore API and setting up data handling mechanisms to process API responses within the ElizaOS framework ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/1)).

- **Release Automation and Configuration**
  A suite of improvements was made to establish a professional release pipeline. GitHub Actions workflows were implemented to automate release management and the publishing of packages to NPM ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/2)). This effort included several configuration fixes and refinements, such as updating the package scope to `@sendo-labs` ([#8](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/8)), removing an unused publish script ([#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/7)), and updating workflow triggers for better efficiency ([#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/5), [#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/6)). This work prepared the project for its first official release ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/3)).
