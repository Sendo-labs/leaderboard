# Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October marked the inception of the CryptoScore plugin for ElizaOS. Development began with the foundational implementation of the plugin, establishing core functionalities for retrieving token and wallet scores via the CryptoScore API. Following the initial feature work, the focus shifted to building robust infrastructure, with the implementation of automated GitHub Actions workflows for release management and NPM publishing. This foundational work has prepared the project for its first official release and streamlined the process for future contributions and deployments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on two primary themes: initial feature implementation and the establishment of release infrastructure.

-   **Initial Plugin Implementation & API Integration**
    The project kicked off with the initial implementation of the CryptoScore plugin. This foundational effort included setting up the core services to interact with the CryptoScore API, enabling the retrieval of token and wallet scores. It also established the necessary data handling mechanisms to process and format API responses for use within the ElizaOS framework ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/1)).

-   **Release Automation and Package Configuration**
    Significant effort was dedicated to creating a streamlined release process. New GitHub Actions workflows were introduced to automate release management, changelog generation, and publishing to NPM ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/2)). This work included several refinements, such as updating workflow triggers and references for efficiency ([#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/5), [#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/6)). Minor bug fixes were also addressed in `package.json` to ensure correct package scoping and remove unused scripts ([#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/7), [#8](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/8)).
