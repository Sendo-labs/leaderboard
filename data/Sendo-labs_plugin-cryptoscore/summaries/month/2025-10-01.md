# Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October marked the inception of the CryptoScore plugin for ElizaOS. The month began with the foundational implementation, establishing the core functionality for retrieving token and wallet scores via the CryptoScore API. Development quickly progressed to building robust infrastructure, with the introduction of automated GitHub Actions workflows for versioning, changelog generation, and publishing to NPM. This rapid transition from initial code to a structured, publishable package sets a strong foundation for the plugin's future development and integration within the Sendo ecosystem.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month focused on establishing the plugin from the ground up, covering both core features and essential development infrastructure.

- **Initial Plugin Implementation**
  The project kicked off with the initial implementation of the CryptoScore plugin. This foundational work included setting up the plugin for ElizaOS, creating services to interact with the CryptoScore API, and implementing data handling for API responses. This enables AI agents to begin analyzing cryptocurrency token and wallet scores ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/1)).

- **Release Automation and Publishing Workflows**
  A significant effort was made to establish a mature release process. Automated GitHub Actions workflows were created to handle versioning, changelog generation, and publishing the package to NPM, ensuring consistency and efficiency ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/2)). This was followed by several refinements to the package configuration and workflow triggers to streamline the publishing process ([#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/6), [#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/7), [#8](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/8)). The first release, v1.0.0, was also prepared ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/3)).

- **Dependency Maintenance**
  Towards the end of the month, routine maintenance was performed to update project dependencies and the plugin version, ensuring the project remains stable and secure ([#9](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/9)).
