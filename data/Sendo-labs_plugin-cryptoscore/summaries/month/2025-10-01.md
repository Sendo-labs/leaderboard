# Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October marked the inception of the CryptoScore plugin for ElizaOS. Development began with the foundational implementation of core features, enabling AI agents to retrieve token and wallet scores by integrating with the CryptoScore API. Following the initial feature implementation, the focus shifted to establishing robust infrastructure, with the creation of automated GitHub Actions workflows for versioning, release management, and publishing to NPM. This foundational work in both functionality and process sets a strong precedent for future development and contribution.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on two primary themes: initial feature implementation and the setup of development infrastructure.

-   **Initial Plugin Implementation**
    The project kicked off with the creation of the CryptoScore plugin for ElizaOS. This initial version introduced the core capabilities for retrieving token scores and performing wallet analysis. The work included setting up the necessary services to communicate with the CryptoScore API and implementing data handling logic to process the responses ([#1](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/1)).

-   **Automated Release and Publishing Workflows**
    A significant effort was made to automate the release and NPM publishing process. A new GitHub Actions workflow was introduced to handle releases and publish packages, complete with configurations for versioning and changelog generation ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/2)). Subsequent refinements included updating the plugin's scope ([#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/6)), removing an unused script ([#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/7)), and adjusting the NPM publishing trigger to activate on pull request merges ([#8](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/8)). This work culminated in a pull request for the initial `1.0.0` release ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/3)).
