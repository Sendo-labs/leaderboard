# Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore Weekly Report (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts were concentrated on establishing a robust foundation for the project's release lifecycle. The primary focus was on infrastructure and process automation, with the implementation of new GitHub Actions workflows to handle release management and NPM package publishing. These foundational improvements were complemented by several configuration fixes, ensuring the package is correctly scoped and prepared for distribution. This work paves the way for the plugin's initial release and future streamlined deployments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Development activity centered on preparing the plugin for its first public release through automation and configuration refinement.

- **Automated Release & Publishing Workflows:** A significant effort was made to streamline the deployment process. New GitHub Actions workflows were introduced to automate release management, changelog generation, and publishing to NPM ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/2)). The triggers for these workflows were refined to activate on pull request merges, and references to reusable workflows were updated to ensure efficiency and maintainability ([#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/5), [#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/6)).

- **Package Configuration Fixes:** Several minor but important bug fixes were merged to correct the `package.json` configuration. This included removing an unused publish script and updating the package's scope to `@sendo-labs`, which is critical for proper identification and distribution on NPM ([#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/7), [#8](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/8)).

- **Initial Release Preparation:** In line with the infrastructure setup, a pull request for the initial `1.0.0` release was opened, signaling that the project is nearing its first official version ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/3)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
