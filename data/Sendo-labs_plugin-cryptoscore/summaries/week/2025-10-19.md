# Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore Weekly Report (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts were concentrated on establishing a robust foundation for the plugin's release lifecycle. The primary focus was on automating the release and NPM publishing processes through new GitHub Actions workflows. Key work included configuring release versioning, generating changelogs, and refining package configurations to ensure correct identification and distribution. This foundational work culminated in the preparation for the plugin's initial `1.0.0` release.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Development activity centered on creating a streamlined and automated deployment pipeline.

- **Automated Release and Publishing Workflows:** A significant effort was made to automate the deployment process. New GitHub Actions workflows were implemented to handle release management and publish packages to NPM automatically ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/2)). The NPM publishing trigger was specifically configured to run on pull request merges, and references to reusable workflows were updated to improve efficiency and maintainability ([#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/5), [#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/6)).

- **Package Configuration and Bug Fixes:** Several small but important fixes were made to the `package.json` file. An unused publish script was removed, and the package scope was correctly updated to `@sendo-labs`, ensuring the plugin is properly identified within the ecosystem ([#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/7), [#8](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/8)).

- **Initial Release Preparation:** In preparation for the first official release, a pull request was opened to publish version `1.0.0` of the plugin ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/3)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The issue tracker remained quiet during this period, with development focused on the initial setup and release process.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed this week.
- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were reported, and there were no active issues with significant discussion.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
