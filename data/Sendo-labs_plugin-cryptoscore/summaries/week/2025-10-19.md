# Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore Weekly Report (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts were concentrated on establishing a robust foundation for the plugin's release lifecycle. The primary achievement was the implementation of a fully automated release and NPM publishing pipeline using GitHub Actions. This foundational work streamlines future deployments and ensures consistency. Alongside this, several configuration fixes were merged to correctly scope the package and clean up the `package.json` file, culminating in preparations for the inaugural `1.0.0` release.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
All development this week focused on infrastructure and package configuration to prepare the plugin for public release.

- **Automated Release & Publishing Pipeline**
  A new set of GitHub Actions workflows was introduced to automate the entire release process. This includes generating changelogs, creating release tags, and publishing the package to NPM upon pull request merges. This automation is critical for establishing a reliable and efficient deployment strategy for the plugin. Key work includes the initial workflow implementation ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/2)), updates to workflow triggers ([#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/6)), and adjustments to reusable workflow references ([#5](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/5)). This effort paved the way for the `1.0.0` release PR ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/3)).

- **Package Configuration Fixes**
  Minor but important adjustments were made to the project's `package.json`. The plugin's scope was correctly updated to `@sendo-labs` ([#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/7)), ensuring proper namespacing within the ecosystem. Additionally, an unused publish script was removed to clean up the package configuration ([#8](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/8)).
