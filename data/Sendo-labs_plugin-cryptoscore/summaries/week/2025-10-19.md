# Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore Weekly Report (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts were concentrated on establishing the foundational infrastructure for the project's release lifecycle. The primary achievement was the implementation of automated release and NPM publishing workflows via GitHub Actions. This new CI/CD pipeline streamlines the process from code merge to package publication, ensuring consistency and efficiency for future updates. These preparations culminated in a pull request for the initial `1.0.0` release, marking a significant step towards the project's public launch.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Development focused exclusively on building and refining the project's release and packaging mechanisms.

- **Automated Release and Publishing Workflow:** The core work involved creating a robust, automated pipeline for versioning, changelog generation, and publishing to NPM. New GitHub Actions workflows were introduced to handle these processes, significantly reducing manual overhead for future releases ([#2](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/2)).

- **Configuration and Workflow Adjustments:** Several follow-up changes were made to fine-tune the new automation. This included updating the plugin's package scope ([#6](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/6)), removing an unused publish script ([#7](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/7)), and refining the NPM publish trigger to activate correctly upon pull request merges ([#8](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/8)).

- **Initial Release Preparation:** With the new automation in place, a pull request was opened to manage the project's first official release, version `1.0.0` ([#3](https://github.com/Sendo-labs/plugin-cryptoscore/pull/3)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
It was a quiet week for issue tracking, with all focus on development infrastructure.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed this week.
- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were reported, and there are no active issues with ongoing discussions.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was characterized by a focused effort on a single, critical objective: release automation. The series of interconnected pull requests indicates a methodical approach to building out the project's CI/CD infrastructure. There were no major discussions noted in issues or pull requests, suggesting a clear and well-defined track of work.
